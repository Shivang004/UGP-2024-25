Your task is to analyze abstracts from the Materials Research Society (MRS) conferences and extract exactly 5 concise and specific keywords or phrases from each abstract. These keywords should: 1. Reflect the core topics, materials, techniques, or methods discussed in the abstract. 2. Be specific to the research focus of the abstract (e.g., \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mperovskite solar cells\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m instead of \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124msolar cells\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m). 3.

Xiangcheng Sun 1 , Kai Sun 2 , Bo Cui 1 1 Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, 2 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United StatesShow AbstractSince the pioneering work of Goodenough in 1997 [1], because of its suitable operating voltage and high theoretical capacity (170 mAh/g) as well as its low cost, non-toxicity and safety properties, the olivine lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) has particularly become an attractive cathode material [2] for the design and fabrication of higher power lithium-ion batteries that especially used for hybrid and pure electric vehicles. In this study, the carbon-coated LiFePO4/C composite cathode materials were scale-up synthesized by larger volume solid state reaction method using the precursors of FeSO4, NH4H2PO4, Li2CO3 and conducting carbon source. The surface morphology and phase structures of those LiFePO4/C composite powders are fully investigated by the combinational techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, HR-TEM), and electron diffraction (SAED), and high angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) image analysis on the nanometer scale.The homogenous features of graphitic carbon-coating layer are clearly revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it indicated that the as-synthesized composite powders had a carbon layer of about 8-10 nm. The valence state of Fe ions was also detected by high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS).The revealed features of graphitic carbon-coating on those composite surfaces allows improving the electronic conductivity and reducing the diffusion path of the lithium ions, as evidenced from electrochemical test of charge-discharge cycling in LiFePO4/C composite samples. The LiFePO4/C composites delivered an initial discharge capacity of 157 mAh/g at a 0.2 C rate as the cathode. It also showed an excellent capacity retention ratio of 100% after the 50th charging/discharging cycle.References:[1] A. K. Padhi, K. S. Nanjundaswamy and J. B.

Jr-Sheng Tian 1 , Yue-Han Wu 1 , Wei-Lin Wang 1 , Chun-Yen Peng 1 , Yen-Teng Ho 1 , Ying-Hao Chu 1 , Li Chang 1 1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu TaiwanShow AbstractZnO, a wurzite material with 3.37 eV direct bandgap, is promising for optoelectronic applications. Conventional ZnO is grown in polar <0001> direction, thus suffering from large electric field due to strong polarization. To be free of the polarization effects, growth of nonpolar ZnO has acquired much attention. However, in the absence of low cost commercial ZnO substrate, nonpolar (11-20) and (10-10) ZnO films are usually deposited on foreign substrates which results in many defects, like stacking faults and dislocations. It is known that (11-20) ZnO grown on r-plane sapphire often has high density of dislocations and stacking faults in the order of 5×1010 cm-2 and 105 cm-1, respectively, which severely limit device performance and operating lifetime. However, study of semipolar ZnO with their characteristics is rarely reported. Here, we show that epitaxial semipolar (11-2-2) ZnO can be successfully grown on (112) LaAlO3/LSAT substrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). LaAlO3 in about 100 nm thickness was also epitaxially grown on LSAT by PLD. (11-2-2) X-ray rocking curve results show that the FWHM from a 1.6 μm thick ZnO film can be lower than 400 arcsec. From XRD phi-scan and selected-area electron diffraction, the epitaxial relationships are (11-2-2)ZnO ∥ (112)LAO/LSAT and [11-23]ZnO ∥ [11-1]LAO/LSAT. From cross-section TEM observations, most of dislocations are identified as a+c-type dislocations and the distribution of dislocation density could be distinguished into three regions according to the film thickness. In region I, the first 100 nm above interface, it is found that there are high-density defects accumulated probably due to their strong interaction. In the next 300 nm, region II, the dislocation density is about 3×109 cm-2, and the density further reduces to 5×108 cm-2 in upper layer (region III). The reduction of dislocation density could be explained by strong interaction among dislocations. Furthermore, stacking faults in the ZnO film are seldom observed implies low stacking fault density (≤104 cm-1).\n",

Takatoshi Yamada 1 , Masataka Hasegawa 1 , Christoph Nebel 2 , Yuki Kudo 3 , Tomoaki Masuzawa 3 , Ken Okano 3 1 , National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba Japan, 2 , Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics, Freiburg Germany, 3 , International Christian University, Mitaka JapanShow AbstractDiamond is expected to be one of the promising materials for field emission devices, since diamond surface has negative or small positive electron affinity. H-terminated n-type diamond NEA  surface is the best solution for low voltage driven field emitters. However, a higher electric field was necessary to emit electrons from n-type diamond NEA surface [1]. It was speculated that an internal barrier existed at n-type diamond NEA limit field emission properties [2]. Here, we estimated the effective electric field on n-type diamond NEA surface from results of field emission characteristics and evaluated the effective emission barrier height using ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterizations. n-type diamond films were homoepitaxialy grown on (111) oriented high temperature high pressure Ib synthetic diamonds using micro-wave plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In order to form NEA, H-plasma treatment was carried out.Diamonds were mounted as cathodes in high vacuum system and the emission current vs anode voltage (I-V) characteristics as a function of anode-cathode distances were measured. W needle was used for an anode electrode.    UPS measurements was carried out to evaluate electron affinity and to determine the surface Fermi level. He I (21.2 eV) was used to excite.Threshold voltage vs distance (Vth-d) characteristics, obtained from the I-V characteristics, showed almost linear relationship between turn-on voltage and distance. Slope of this Vth-d characteristics indicates an average electric field in vacuum [3]. By taking field enhancement factor of  10 into account [4], the effective electric field (Eeff) at surface was calculated to be 5.4 x 106 V/cm. Schottkey barrier lowering model was applied to estimate the internal barrier height. Using the calculated effective electric field (Eeff), the internal barrier height was estimated to be 3.3 eV. This was almost same as the energy difference between bulk and surface conduction band minimum obtained from UPS. From the results, it was considered that the obtained higher filed is necessary to lower the internal barrier for the electron emission. In order to utilize NEA on n-type diamond surface for the low voltage driven field emitters, the reduction of the internal barrier height is the key technique.The present work is financially supported by the Support Program for Private Universities S0801012) and 10 Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (19205026), both from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology, Japan.

Marco Cavallari 1 , Vinicius Zanchin 1 , Cleber Amorim 2 , Gerson Santos 1 , Fernando Fonseca 1 , Adnei Andrade 3 , Sergio Mergulhao 2 1 Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletrônicos (PSI), Escola Politécnica - Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, 2 Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil, 3 , Instituto de Eletrotécnica e Energia - Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilShow AbstractCharge transport in polymeric films can be investigated through stationary (e.g. current versus voltage) and transient (e.g. Time-of-Flight – ToF, Dark-Injection Space-Charge-Limited Current – DI-SCLC, Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage – CELIV) current techniques [1,2]. Even though ToF is the most common technique for mobility characterization [3], it suffers from two limitations in nanometric films: (i) charge carrier transit time must be lower than dielectric relaxation time (ttr < τσ) and (ii) higher than RC constant (ttr > τRC). For such situations, a ToF variety proposed by Juška et al. [4] for high-mobility semiconductors is mandatory.In this context, this work suggests the application and comparison of CELIV, current and integral modes ToF to investigate transport in organic materials. Poly[2-methoxy-5-(3',7'-dimethylloctyloxy)-1-4-phenylene vinylene] (MDMO-PPV), poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1-4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were herein analyzed, due to their application in large-area electronics, low-cost printable electronics and flexible circuits [5].An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) structure was used on indium tin oxide anode over glass (Delta, unpolished, 30 – 60 Ω/sq.). MDMO-PPV (Merck, Mw = 1 150 kg/mol, Mn = 170 kg/mol), MEH-PPV (Σ-Aldrich, Mn = 150 – 250 kg/mol) and P3HT (ADS, regioregularity > 95 %, Mw = 10 – 35 kDa, Mw/Mn = 2.0) in 7 – 25 mg/ml chloroform solutions were agitated for 24 hours and spun at 500 – 3 000 rpm for 60 s. Samples were then heated at 55 °C during 60 min. Resultant thickness of the films was 0.2 – 0.4 µm for MDMO-PPV, 0.45 – 3 µm for MEH-PPV, while 0.1 – 10 µm for P3HT. After aluminum anode evaporation, devices were encapsulated with glass under inert atmosphere.Measurements were performed in a closed-cycle Janis cryostat with Lake-Shore 330 temperature controller (140 to 330 K). Electric signals were generated by a wave function generator Agilent 33120A with a nitrogen Oriel laser, and measured through a current amplifier Stanford Research 570 coupled to an oscilloscope Tektronix 340A.Mobility approached 10-5 cm2/V.s with Poole-Frenkel behavior for PPV derivatives and 10-2 cm2/V.s for P3HT. The alternative integral-ToF for films as thin as 100 nm provided comparable results to current-ToF in micrometric layers and CELIV. Deviation due to P3HT film thickness variation could be the result of higher crystallinity and increased light absorption from casting.

Bo  Chen 1 , Kathy Lu 1 1 Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United StatesShow AbstractOver the past decade, electrochemical anodization of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes has been studied intensively and mainly focused on uniform diameters throughout the TiO2 nanotubes depth direction. In the present study, we demonstrate a generic method to fabricate hierarchically branched TiO2 nanotubes by adjusting the anodization voltage. Initially ordered root TiO2 nanotubes are obtained by the typical two-step anodization. After the formation of root nanotubes during the second-step anodization, the applied voltage is decreased by a factor of sqrt(1/n) to generate n-branched nanotubes (1~n, “~” stands for the junction where the branching takes place, and n stands for the number of branches produced) from the root nanotube, and the diameter of the branched nanotubes is sqrt(1/n) of the root nanotube. The number of branches and the diameter of the branched nanotubes are dependent on the reduction of the applied voltage. If the applied voltage is further decreased by a factor of sqrt(1/m), each of the branched nanotubes further subdivides into m smaller nanotubes (1~n~m). Continuing this approach, four layers of branched TiO2 nanotubes with 1~n~m~k structures are obtained. As a result, hierarchically branched TiO2 nanotubes with controlled diameters are achieved. On the other hand, when the anodization voltage is increased by a factor of n, some nanotubes enlarge the diameter to n times of the root nanotubes, while other nanotubes terminate the growth. As a result, TiO2 nanotubes with n~1 structure are obtained. A combination of 1~n branched nanotubes with n~1 TiO2 nanotubes leads to anodized TiO2 nanotubes with 1~n~1  structure. This novel approach not only generates hierarchically branched TiO2 nanotube structures, but will also open up new opportunities for the applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysts.\n",

Phillip Olk 1 , Thomas Haertling 2 , Dong Chul Kim 1 , Helge Weman 1 1 IET, NTNU, Trondheim Norway, 2 IFZP, Fraunhofer, Dresden GermanyShow AbstractA key challenge for future nanoscale electronics in commercial applications is the bridge between nanoscopic devices, such as nanowires, and the macroscopic world, e.g., microcontacts. This issue may seem trivial, but the transition to single wire devices has large implications on the applicable industrial processes:Traditional methods, namely electron beam lithography and mask-based UV lithography, suffer from some drawbacks. For research purposes and prototypes, a time-consuming execution of iterative and costly steps in electron beam lithography may be acceptable, if such a tool is accessible in the first place. On the other hand, UV lithography, a highly developed dedicated mass production technique, is either too unflexible (rigid mask layout), unprecise (positioning relative to individual nanowire), or if the first two issues are addressed properly, costly.Here we present a contacting method that provides electric connections for nanowires in a maskless, all-optical way, by means of photodeposition. The photochemical deposition is a site-selective method that deposits metal at illuminated areas well under the diffraction limit. The nanowire itself serves as \"seed\" for the photo-induced reduction of metal salt to pure metal (1). By lateral displacement of the substrate, the metal deposition is manipulated into the according direction, and scribing of metal leads is possible.In this contribution, the method is explained in detail. Subsequently, I/V characterizations of single nanowires demonstrate successful contacting of individual, pre-selected nanowires. The presented technique is compared to typical results achieved by electron beam lithography. Contact quality, and reliability are discussed, answering the key question if the presented procedure permits quick and reproducible contacting of nanostructures for the fractions of the costs of an electron microscope.(1) T.

Specifically, while the observation of sub-Poissonian statistics or anti-bunching behavior in the second-order photon correlation function (g(2)) provides an unambiguous proof on non-classical nature of their radiation, super-Poissonian or photon bunching from single quantum emitters signifies a strong correlation between a pair of photons emitted from two successive electronic transitions. An ability to manipulate this statistical property of quantum emitters could bring breakthroughs in their potential applications as single and/or entangled photon pair sources that are critically needed for quantum communication.Here, we present photon statistics studies of photoluminescence (PL) emission from individual core/shell CdSe/CdS nanocrystal quantum dots(NQDs) that are coupled with local plasmonic fields in the proximity of a rough silver surface. We demonstrate that the interaction with localized plasmons can modify the photon emission statistics of an individual core-shell NQD from photon antibunching to strong photon-bunching.  This unique phenomenon was observed in the low excitation limit (average electron-hole pair,〈N〉<< 1) where the degree of photon-bunching is determined by the ratio between single exciton and bi-exciton quantum yields. Interestingly, we also observe that, as the pump power increases, the degree of photon-bunching (i.e. the height of zero-delay peak in g(2) measurement : g(2)(0)) is first reduced, featuring  a dramatic transition from photon-bunching to incomplete photon anti-bunching (g(2)(0)<1) , and then gradually grows toward the Poissonian limit (i.e. g(2)(0) = 1) at very high pump power (〈N〉>> 1). Our detailed analysis allows us to attribute these interesting behaviors to plasmonic effects on the competition between radiative and non-radiative recombination channels, which ultimately lead to a condition where the quantum yield of the bi-exciton states becomes greater than that of the single exciton state.  In addition to photon pair generation technology, this observation may have a profound impact on lasing applications, which require efficient emission of bi-exciton states.  Furthermore, since this phenomenon can in principle be manifest in any quantum emitter that allows a relatively efficient radiative recombination of bi-exciton state, our work also presents plasmonic coupling as a new, novel route toward achieving manipulation on photon emission statistics of individual quantum emitters in general.\n",

Hans Hofsaess 1 , Kun Zhang 1 , Ulrich Vetter 1 , Omar Bobes 1 , Andre Pape 1 , Marc Broetzmann 1 1 II. Physikalisches Institut, Georg-August-Universitaet Goettingen, Goettingen GermanyShow AbstractWe will present results on metal surfactant driven self-organized pattern formation on surfaces by ion beam erosion, with a focus on the role of phase separation for the initial steps of pattern formation. In our experiments Si substrates were irradiated with 5 keV Xe ions at normal incidence and ion fluences up to 5*10^17 Xe+ ions per cm^2 under continuous deposition of surfactant atoms. In the absence of such surfactants uniform flat surfaces are obtained, while in the presence of Fe and Mo surfactants pronounced patterns like dots, combinations of dots and ripples with wavelengths around 100 nm are generated [1]. The surfactant coverage and deposition direction determine the pattern type and the pattern orientation, respectively. A critical steady-state coverage for onset of dot formation and onset of ripple formation is in the range of 10^15 and 5*10^15 atoms per cm^2. With increasing ion fluence the pattern contrast increases but the pattern type remains unchanged. The steady-state surface region consists of a thin amorphous metal silicide layer with high metal concentration in the ripple and dot regions. Pattern formation is explained by ion induced diffusion and phase separation of the initially flat amorphous silicide layer and subsequent ion beam erosion with composition dependent sputter yield. Directed deposition of metal surfactants causes preferential deposition and shadowing and determines the final pattern orientation and morphology. To investigate the role of initial phase separation we additionally compare the pattern formation for different other metal surfactants. [1] H. Hofsaess, K. Zhang, M. Broetzmann, New. J.

Philip Born 1 , Tobias Kraus 1 1 Structure Formation Group, Leibniz Institute for New Materials (INM), Saarbrücken GermanyShow AbstractParticles in a size range between 1 μm and 50 nm can be assembled from their dispersion by moving its meniscus over a substrate. Depending on the geometry and the substrate, uniform dense layers or sparse patterns of particles are deposited.A meniscus that moves over a patterned substrate at a non-wetting contact angle can selectively deposit particles on patterned regions (“capillary assembly”) [1]. The yield depends on the local particle concentration. Assembly with reasonable efficiency thus requires an “accumulation zone” that is enriched with particles. It is out of this volume that particles are deposited on the patterned sites of the template.Assembly from a wetting liquid yields continuous particle films (“convective assembly”) [2]. Particles are transported into a thin liquid film by convection, where they assemble into a densely packed layer. The assembly process relies on forces exerted by the liquid flow. It is strongly affected by the shape of the meniscus that confines the particles. We show that the mechanical behavior of the meniscus governs the attainable quality of assembled films [3].We will discuss the effects of fluid motion, gas-liquid interfaces and particle interactions on the outcome of these assembly processes. The results guide the choice of assembly setup geometries, process variables and particle types for high-quality particle assembly at high yields.[1] Kraus, Malaquin, Schmid, Riess, Spencer, and Wolf, Nature Nanotechnology 2007, 2, 570-576[2] Malaquin, Kraus, Schmid, Delamarche, and Wolf, Langmuir 2007, 23, 11513-11521[3] Born, Blum, Munoz, and Kraus, Langmuir 2011 ASAP, DOI: 10.1021/la2006138\n",

Lateef Uddin Syed 1 , Luxi Zhang 1 , Allan Prior 1 , Jianwei Liu 1 , Duy Hua 1 , Jun Li 1 1 Chemistry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United StatesShow AbstractGlobally, thousands of lives are lost every day from various types of cancers. The best way of preventing these deaths is early diagnosis and effective treatment. It is well known that overexpression of certain enzymes such as kinases, phosphatase, and proteases causes cancers.     Legumain (also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase) is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose activity is found in several tissues. Legumain is found highly expressed in a majority of tumors including carcinomas of the breast, colon, and prostate, and in central nervous system neoplasms. However, overexpression is not found in normal cells. Legumain is present intracellularly in endosome/lysosome systems and extracellularly in tumor microenvironment, consequently making it a potential cancer biomarker. It has also been reported that legumain specifically cleaves asparaginyl carbonyl bond. Nanostructured carbon materials have attracted extensive attention for various electroanalytical applications, particularly in the form of nanoelectrodes. In the present study, we employed embedded vertically aligned carbon nanofiber (VACNF) nanoelectrode array (NEA), where only the ends of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are exposed at the surface of the insulating SiO2 matrix. The exposed CNF tips were functionalized with an electroactive ferrocene (Fc)-linked tetrapeptide (Ala-Ala-Asn-Leu-Fc). The asparagine site (C-terminus) of the tetrapeptide  is cleaved by legumain, which results in the release of Fc moieties from the electrode to the bulk solution, leading to a drastic decrease in the electrochemical signal. Towards achieving this goal, as a first step to understand the electron transfer phenomenon at the CNFs, the exposed CNF tips were functionalized with Fc moieties and a careful electrochemical investigation of electron transfer rate (ETR) with direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) voltammetric techniques was carried out. Our results show striking difference in ETR between DC and AC voltammetric measurements, revealing an anomalous phenomenon of electron transfer at CNF NEAs that is likely defined by the intrinsic properties of CNFs rather than the faradaic process at the electrode surface. We observed 100 times higher ETR by AC voltammetry than by DC voltammetry. The electrochemical properties of the nanoelectrode were found to critically depend on the unique conical graphitic stacking of the CNFs, which facilitates a new capacitive pathway in high-frequency AC voltammetric measurements. This study indicates that selecting an appropriate electrochemical technique can cope with the intrinsic limit of nanoelectrode materials.  Particularly, high-frequency AC voltammetry can provide high-performance nano-biosensors and nanoelectronics with CNF NEAs. These findings are being utilized to build an ultrasensitive legumain biosensor for electrochemical monitoring of legumain activity in various cancerous cell lines.\n",

Gautam Gupta 1 , Thomas Vanasse 1 , Clinton Kehres 1 , Chirag Shah 2 1 , Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, United States, 2 , Exova, Glendale Heights, Illinois, United StatesShow AbstractPorous Ti6Al4V structures have been used in orthopedic applications for their excellent biocompatibility. However, the pore structure and mechanical properties of such structures have to be optimized to support bone ingrowth and improve implant fixation. Traditional manufacturing methods to create porous structures often do not allow flexibility in design of complex geometries. The advances with additive manufacturing techniques like electron beam melting (EBM) provide flexibility in selecting design features to achieve this. In this study, a high resolution micro-CT scan of human cancellous bone was obtained from cadaver humeral head. This data was converted into STL file, and porous Ti6Al4V structures that mimic cancellous bone were produced in a vacuum chamber by consolidation of thin layers of metal powder. The manufacturing parameters were controlled to optimize the pore-size, strength and modulus of the porous structure. SEM image analysis showed that the pores were in the size range of 200-900 microns, with an average pore-size of 580 microns. The average porosity, as determined by Archimedes principle was about 65%. Mechanical testing showed that compressive strength and modulus were 92 MPa and 0.72 GPa, respectively. EDX analysis confirmed that the final chemical composition of the Ti6Al4V alloy was within the acceptable limit per ASTM F136. To determine the bone ingrowth within the porous structure, cylindrical Ti6Al4V samples (10 mm diameter X 20mm long) containing the cancellous bone like structure were implanted in sheep tibiae and femora. Porous Ti6Al4V structures manufactured with traditional methods like sintering were used as control. The 12 week long study is ongoing. At the end of the study, histological analysis will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of bone ingrowth into the porous metal with bone-like structure. The advances in manufacturing technologies provide freedom of design that can create new opportunities for improved implant fixation.\n",

Kendra Erk 1 , Kenneth Shull 2 1 Polymers Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States, 2 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United StatesShow AbstractNonlinear elasticity observed in shear rheometry experiments is coupled with molecular constitutive models and scaling laws to establish the relationships between the observed macroscale mechanical properties of a model physically associating gel with its underlying microstructural evolution during shear.  Compared to previous studies of nonlinearity in soft materials, the work performed here benefits from studying polymer gels with well-defined molecular structures and a wide range of accessible relaxation times.The model gel is composed of acrylic triblock copolymer dissolved in a midblock-selective solvent.   At elevated temperatures, the copolymer is fully dissolved and the solution behaves as a viscoelastic liquid with near Maxwellian relaxation.  As the solution is cooled, the copolymer self-assembles into a three-dimensional transient network composed of spherical endblock aggregates interconnected by flexible midblock bridges.  The relaxation time increases dramatically as temperature is reduced, such that at room temperature the system behaves as a viscoelastic gel.  The temperature-dependent structure and resulting range of viscous-to-elastic behavior allow for these gels to be deformed at reduced rates (product of applied shear rate and the gel’s relaxation time) that span almost four orders of magnitude.During shear at a constant rate, strain-stiffening behavior is observed at small strains and related to the finite extensibility of the midblock bridges in the gel via a constitutive model based on an exponential strain energy function.  Interestingly, the same model is also effective for describing the stiffening of various biopolymer networks.  As deformation progresses, stiffening is followed by rapid, fracture-like softening in the stress response which is believed to result from the shear-induced formation of highly localized regions of deformation in the gel.  This behavior is accurately captured by a constitutive model that incorporates the strain energy and relaxation of individual bridges in the gel.  Flow curves predicted from the model are non-monotonic, consistent with the onset of flow instabilities at high shear rates.  At large strains, plateaus in the stress response are observed and compared with results from traditional sliding friction experiments.  Scaling law arguments from this large-strain regime suggest that deformation in the gel is confined to a localized shear zone with thickness comparable to the mesh size of the gel.  The overall nonlinear stress response – stiffening, softening, and stress plateau – also displays an interesting rate dependence which may be evidence of a potential failure-mode transition in the deformed gel.The well-defined network structure of these triblock copolymer gels coupled with their tunable range of relaxation times allow for these gels to be useful model systems for future studies of flow instabilities in physically associating soft materials.\n",

Here, we report novel biomimetic hydrogels formed from hyaluronate (HA) conjugated with the synthetic molecules of cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) and polyamines (PAs). The strong and selective host-guest interaction between CB[6] and PA drives self-assembly of the hydrogels in the presence of cells in vitro and even in vivo. Furthermore, functional “tag” moieties can be easily introduced into the hydrogels during or after gelation by anchoring various “tag”-attached CB[6] to residual PA moieties in the hydrogel. As a model system for tissue engineering applications, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which were genetically modified with recombinant adenovirus and cell permeable peptides to secrete IL-12 for the production of tumor necrosis factor-α, were encapsulated within the HA-CB[6]/PA hydrogels. Then, the HA-CB[6]/PA hydrogels were modularly modified with dexamethasone conjugated CB[6] (DMT-CB[6]). In vitro release tests exhibited the continuous release of IL-12 from the hydrogels for up to 2 weeks. Currently, in vivo applications of the HA-CB[6]/PA/DMT-CB[6] hydrogels encapsulating IL-12 releasing MSCs are under investigation for the treatment of cancer in C57BL/6 melanoma model mice. The clinically feasible in situ forming HA-CB[6]/PA hydrogels by host-guest chemistry will be investigated further for various cell therapy and tissue engineering applications.\n",

Crystal structure prediction remains challenging. [1,2]   Our strategy of modeling crystalline aggregation is based on a multi step process that involves the following elements: (a) conformational search based on quantum mechanical and/or force field optimization; (b) optimization of structures of low energy small aggregates (typically dimers); (c) polymorph prediction based on low energy conformers and aggregates. Conformational analysis is based on separating the molecules into rigid and non-rigid segments. In the end of this multi step process we generate a list of viable crystal structures (LVCS). The modeling is supplemented by extensive validation based on analogues available in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). This validation based on analogues is used to reduce the list of conformers and the list of small aggregates. In steps (b) and (c) we further reduce the LVCSs by eliminating similar items on the list (“clustering”).

      "Failed to extract keywords for line: 10:15 AM - TT1.3 Low Profile Packaging for MEMS Aeroacoustic Sensors. John Burns 1 , Robert White 2 , Joshua Krause 3 1 Mechanical Engineering, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, 2 Mechanical Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, United States, 3 Mechanical Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, United StatesShow AbstractThis paper describes a semi-automated conductive ink process used for packaging MEMS devices. The method is applied to packaging of MEMS acoustic sensors for wind tunnel testing. The primary advantage of the method is a reduction in surface topology between the package and the integrated MEMS sensors. In this particular application, the sensor records surface pressure and shear stress under a turbulent boundary layer. In order to avoid self-noise effects or other modifications to the boundary layer structure associated with surface roughness, the interface between the MEMS sensor and its package must be as close to planar as possible.The thickness of the viscous sub layer below the turbulent boundary layer is the upper bound on allowable surface topology. For wind tunnel flows at free stream velocities between 20 and 200 m/s and plate lengths on the order of half a meter, the Reynolds number is between 10^5 and 10^7. This suggests that the viscous wall unit will be on the order of 1 to 35 micrometers. The viscous sub layer is approximately 5 wall units thick, so surface topologies of between 5 and 175 micrometers are desired. A previous packaging approach using gold wire bonds with CNC machined epoxy fill resulted in a minimum surface topology of greater than 100 micrometers.  In addition, for large arrays of MEMS microphones, yield issues were dominated by wire bond integrity problems. These two issues were the primary motivation for developing the low profile conductive ink process. However, the process is generally useful and can be applied to the packaging of various types of sensor systems that require low profile interconnects.The conductive ink process consists of a low profile, low volumetric resistivity silver conductive ink which is pneumatically dispensed from a syringe between the pads of the printed circuit board package and its integrated sensor. The package and sensor are mounted to an aluminum fixture on top of computer controlled micro-positioning stages for accurate and precise placement of the silver traces. Ongoing tests are being conducted to map the resistivity, contact resistance, and trace geometry to the process parameters of feed rate, syringe diameter, dispense pressure, and dispense duty cycle. The impedance and surface topology of the conductive ink packaging scheme will be compared to previous wire bonded hybrid packaging schemes.The ability to produce low-profile connections easily and effectively allows for a simple integration of MEMS devices into low topology packages. By optimizing the flow characteristics of the conductive ink through the syringe, the velocity of the micro-positioning stages, and the graphic user interface, the height of the silver traces can be reduced to fewer than 50 micrometers in order to achieve low profile, low resistance, and versatile connections for a wide variety of applications. In addition, process compatibility with a variety of release etchants is under investigation.\n",

Robert Furstenberg 1 , Christopher Kendziora 1 , Michael Papantonakis 1 , Viet Nguyen 1 , R. McGill 1 1 , NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, WASHINGTON, District of Columbia, United StatesShow AbstractWith the increasing materials complexity of MEMS devices, there is a growing need for new characterization techniques that provide chemical composition with improved spatial resolution.  Existing established techniques are not always well suited for the length scales involved in MEMS devices.  For example, FTIR spectroscopy provides the chemical composition but is principally limited to bulk samples.  While FTIR micro-spectroscopy addresses this problem, the practical resolution limit is limited to about 20 micrometers.  Similar resolution restrictions apply to various X-ray techniques as well.  On the other hand, well-developed imaging techniques at the nanometer scale (TEM/EELS, SPM, AFM etc.) may be impractical at the micron-scale.  The emerging technique of Raman micro-spectroscopy provides adequate spatial resolution (~1 micrometer), but may not always be useful due to its low throughput and in cases where strong fluorescence suppresses the weak Raman signature.  We are developing a new non-contact and non-destructive technique that provides similar information as FTIR or Raman spectroscopy while being immune to fluorescence and at a potentially faster scan rate and/or higher spatial resolution.  It involves photo-thermal heating of the sample with a quantum cascade laser (or other suitable infrared laser) and measuring the resulting increase in thermal emissions (at wavelengths other than the laser wavelength itself) by either an infrared detector or a laser probe consisting of a visible laser reflected from the sample.  The latter case allows for further increase in the spatial resolution from ~10 micrometers to ~1 micrometer or better, with the right experimental conditions. Since the thermal emission signal from the surface is directly proportional to the absorbed laser energy which is in turn proportional to the absorption coefficient, by tuning the wavelength of the infrared laser we can directly measure the FTIR spectrum of the sample.  By raster scanning over the surface of the sample and applying standard chemometric algorithms, we can obtain maps of the chemical composition of the sample surface.  We demonstrate this technique by imaging the surface of a microfabricated flow-through chemical vapor preconcentrator consisting of a silicon frame and a suspended-perforated polyimide membrane with a pair of platinum meander heater traces, coated with a custom sorbent polymer for selective sorption of analyte.  We derive the spatial resolution of our photo-thermal imaging system as well as discuss the conditions under which the spatial resolution can be further increased from the far-field diffraction limited resolution given by the combination of the imaging optic and infrared excitation laser wavelength.  In addition, we compare the relative merits of measuring the infrared photo-thermal and the infrared back-reflectance signal.\n",

Tram Dang 1 1 Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United StatesShow AbstractA combinatorial approach for homogenous molecular electro-catalyst screening for CO2 reduction by means of a high-throughput 25-well parallel electrolyzer is proposed. The potential catalysts were synthesized in situ by mixing solutions of metal salts and ligands together, and placing it directly into the electrolyzer cell. The cell, which incorporates screen printed metal electrodes placed inside a Teflon well block, was then used to perform bulk electrolysis. Active catalysts were then screened by three methods: (1) the presence of CO gas in the electrolyzer head space; (2) a pH change of the individual solutions from before and after bulk electrolysis due to proton consumption during CO2 reduction; and (3) other physical attributes of the solution, such as degradation of the possible catalyst. Of the 25 solutions made, two were selected for further analysis after initial screening. Of the two, nickel cyclam, a well-known CO2 reduction catalyst, was correctly identified to be active.\n",

Composite piezoelectric thick films have shown promise as energy harvesting devices due to their flexibility and applicability over a wide range of frequencies. In the present work, three phase flexible piezoelectric PZT-Epoxy-Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) composite thick films with a thickness of ~ 150 µm have been fabricated. MWCNTs were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication and then PZT and epoxy were added to this solution. This mixture was again sonicated and then desiccated. The volume fraction of the MWCNT phase was varied from 1% to 6%. The three phase mixture was then spin coated over a stainless steel substrate of thickness 20 µm by a two step spin coating procedure to achieve a relatively uniform coating. The thick films were poled at a voltage of 2.2 kV/mm to align the dipoles of the piezoelectric phase. The measured values for the piezoelectric strain coefficients, d31, d33, dielectric constant, ε and tan(δ) were found to increase with the volume fraction of the MWCNTs due to the effect of an increase in polarization of the Zr/Ti dipoles with higher MWCNT volume fraction. Both the d31 and d33 values drop after the percolation threshold is reached. The percolation threshold with constant PZT volume fraction and varying MWCNT volume fraction was seen at 30%, 65% and 5% volume fractions of PZT, Epoxy and MWCNT respectively. The electromechanical properties of the thick films depend on the microstructure , clustering of PZT, contact resistance between MWCNT and the different phases, and the surface morphology of the thick films. SEM, TEM and AFM images of the films were used to investigate the effect of the microstructure on the electromechanical response of the thick films.\n",

In the present work, the matrix of two phase PZT-Epoxy composites was reinforced with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) inclusions with aspect ratios that varied from 20 - 30. The composites were fabricated by using the sol gel process. MWCNT inclusions were functionalized with ethanol and subsequently added to a solution that was comprised of PZT and epoxy. The composites were poled at a high voltage of 2.2 kV/mm to align the Zr/Ti dipoles in the PZT phase. The measured values for the piezoelectric strain coefficient, d33, dielectric constant, ε and tan(δ) were found to increase with the volume fraction of the MWCNTs due to the effect of an increase in polarization of the Zr/Ti dipoles with higher MWCNT volume fraction. With the increase in the volume fraction of the MWCNT inclusions, conductive pathways are formed that hinder charge separation, which leads to percolation. The composites show a sudden drop in d33 values with a considerable increase in the dielectric constant at the onset of the percolation threshold. The percolation threshold with constant PZT volume fraction (30%) and varying MWCNT volume fraction (1-10%) was seen when the volume fraction of MWCNT was 5%. The percolation threshold is an important parameter that helps us in optimizing the electromechanical characteristics of the piezoelectric composites. Microstructural properties such as agglomeration of MWCNT inclusions and clustering of PZT inclusions in the Epoxy matrix and the contact resistance between the different phases have significant effects on the electromechanical properties of the composite. The present work also includes the analysis of the microstructure of the composites and also the individual phases through SEM and TEM imaging to determine and effects of the aforementioned factors on the electromechanical properties of the composite.\n",

Kuhl 1  Etosha R. Cave 1  David N. Abram 1  Toru  Hatsukade 1  1Stanford University Stanford USAShow AbstractThe development of a cost effective process for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 could enable a shift to a sustainable energy economy and chemical industry. Coupled to a renewable energy source such as wind or solar, such a process could generate carbon neutral fuels or industrial chemicals that are conventionally derived from petroleum. A key technological challenge necessary to enable such a process is the development of catalysts that are active and selective for this reaction, i.e. catalysts that can reduce CO2 at low overpotentials, generate desirable products at high current densities over long periods of time, and do so selectively without the formation of unwanted byproducts. In this paper, we report new insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a number of metallic surfaces, enabled by the development of an experimental methodology with unprecedented sensitivity for the identification and quantification of CO2 electroreduction products. This involves a custom electrochemical cell designed to maximize product concentrations coupled to gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance for the identification and quantification of gas and liquid products, respectively. We will start by addressing CO2 reduction chemistry on copper, where across a range of potentials we observed a total of 16 different CO2 reduction products, five of which are reported for the first time. This provides the most complete view of the reaction chemistry on copper reported to date. Taking into account the chemical identities of the wide range of C1-C3 products generated and the potential-dependence of their turnover frequencies, mechanistic information is deduced. We discuss a scheme for the formation of multicarbon products involving enol-like surface intermediates as a possible pathway, accounting for the observed selectivity for eleven distinct C2+ oxygenated products including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids. We then expanded our studies to several other transition metal surfaces, including Ni, Pt, Au, Zn, Ag, and Fe among others. Utilizing the same experimental methodologies described above, we identified a number of new products never-before reported on these metals, and have uncovered design principles based on the electronic and geometric properties of these surfaces that influence reaction activity and selectivity. These results will be presented within a coherent framework that will provide insight for developing improved catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals.\n",

However, unlike regular tandem cells, the stack-junction cell has four terminals. And no current matching is needed because top and bottom sub cells are electrically separated. In the stack-junction cell based on Si top sub cell, the optimum band gap of the bottom cell is 0.68 eV in order to fully utilize the whole solar spectrum. Germanium is selected as a material for bottom sub cell because the band gap of Ge is 0.66 eV and very closes to the optimum. Si top cell has interdigitated front contact (IFC) structure and Ge bottom cell has interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure. IFC Si junction was formed by boron Ion Implantation (IIP) on N type CZ wafer. Thermal oxide combined with PECVD SiNx ARC was used to passivate the Si surface. For local contacts, high dose IIPs were used and titanium silicidation were formed by one step RTA. IBC Ge cell process is similar to IFC Si cell fabrication. Ge solar cell is not as extensively investigated as silicon. The optimization of resistivity, surface passivation, junction formation and metal contact are needed in order to realize highly efficient IBC Ge cell. The optimum resistivity of substrate for IBC Ge cell is much different with the screen-printing (SP) cell which is generally used for multi-junction. According to our simulation results, the optimum resistivity of P-type Ge is 0.13 Omega;cm for IBC cell. On the other hand, the optimum resistivity of SP Ge cell is 0.028 Omega;cm that is much smaller than that of IBC Ge cell. For the junction formation, Arsenic that is relatively heavy atom is selected as IIP species because of the relatively heavy weight of germanium atom in comparison with silicon. The selection of passivation layer is also important. In general, oxides are the best passivation layer. However, in the case of Ge, the GeOx was excluded from candidates for passivation until now, because the GeOx is hygroscopic and soluble in water. In the present work, we have overcome the limitations through new processes. The surface recombination velocity of 200cm/s is achieved using this method. For local contacts, high dose IIPs were used and titanium germanide were formed by RTA. We have fabricated 20.9% top Si / 1.6% bottom Ge stack junction with 22.5% module efficiency. Simulations with experiments have been performed. We eventually hope to obtain 26.5% stack module efficiency, higher than the practical efficiency limit of the single Si junction.

We are investigating a three-channel system for such conversion combining photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal approaches. Incident solar spectrum is first concentrated and then split into two major parts: PV and thermal. The PV part of the spectrum is further split into several subbands, which are directed to bandgap appropriate solar cells either laterally aligned on the same Si substrate or on their individual Si substrate. Instead of using expensive Ge or III-V substrates, single crystalline thin film Ge is grown on top of a Si substrate through a two-step selective epitaxial growth. This Ge film is used as a virtual substrate for III-V epitaxy. Unlike vertically stacked multijunction solar cells, no current matching is required. At long and very short wavelengths where PV efficiency is low, solar radiation is directed to a thermal storage tank for electricity generation using heat engines. The PV waste heat from the solar cells due to thermalization of high energy photo-electrons will also be collected for additional electricity generation. The advantages of our approach lie in the high system efficiency with relatively low cost and the capability of generating electricity day and night through thermal energy storage. The solar concentrator is composed of a large array of heliostats that reflect light onto secondary mirrors, which in turn direct light down and onto the entrance of a compound parabolic concentrator. Radiation is then fed into a cavity beam homogenizer, which has several exits equipped with wavelength selective filters, allowing radiation to reach the PV cells and thermal receiver. The concentration factor can reach several hundred times. High temperature heat storage (600-900 °C) is achieved by using molten salt as a phase change material with added graphite flakes for high thermal conductivity. The high temperature heat storage tank allows utilization of supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle, which is more efficient than traditional steam Rankine cycle used in current solar thermal power plants. The PV waste heat can be used as a heat source for electricity generation through an organic Rankine cycle. The PV efficiency is determined by the concentration factor, solar cell temperature, junction materials chosen, and how the solar spectrum is split between the PV and thermal part and among the different bandgap solar cells. Detailed analysis will be carried out through optical and thermal simulations and MATLAB optimizations to decide the optimal values of these variables for the highest system efficiency including the PV, thermal and PV waste heat utilization for electricity generation. With optimized design and neglecting optical loss, system power conversion efficiency can reach more than 50%, including around 10% absolute contribution from thermal and PV waste heat utilization.\n",

Giardini 4  1US Army Research Laboratory Adelphi USA2Colorado School of Mines Golden USA3National Renewable Energy Laboratory Golden USA4US Army Natick Soldier Research Natick USAShow AbstractThe ability to make use of on-site energy resources in the field is of importance to the U.S. Army, allowing for the ability to recharge electrical systems, and thus reducing the amount of stored energy (typically in the form of batteries) that needs to be carried into theater. Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diodes rely on quantum-mechanical tunneling for current generation and are one of the few device structures capable of rectifying radiation absorbed by an antenna designed in the gigahertz and terahertz frequency range (visible and infrared wavelengths). Desired current-voltage characteristics that a MIM device for electrical rectification should exhibit includes high asymmetry, non-linearity, relatively fast responsivity, low hysteresis, low impedance, and a turn-on bias close to 0 V. These characteristics depend primarily on the materials that make up the MIM stack. Important factors of the materials selected for producing a MIM diode with these preferred characteristics include having a high work function difference between the two metals, and having a relatively low insulator barrier height. This study surveys planar MIM tunnel diodes based on niobium and niobium oxide thin films, with varying top metals to determine possible material systems that show the desired electrical characteristics for use in a possible rectenna. The niobium/niobium oxide combination was chosen due to the ability to create a high quality interface between the two materials using an anodic oxidation process, niobium's relatively low work function (and thus, making possible a relatively high work function difference), and niobium oxide's relatively low insulator barrier height compared to other ALD oxides available in the facility. Top metals, including Ag, Au, Cu, and Pt, were chosen based on their relatively high work function differences compared to Nb, and based on findings from previous works 1. A Nb top metal was used as a control. A photolithographically-patterned planar diode structure was used due to its manufacturability and simplicity. Point contact MIM diode devices have been fabricated and characterized using similar material systems in the past, but such devices are not practical from a large-scale manufacturing stand-point due to their very low reproducibility and repeatability. Planar MIM structures are scalable, and can be integrated into standard CMOS processes, as well as other electronic fabrication processes. Initial results show that Nb/Nb2O5/Pt and Nb/Nb2O5/Au MIM diodes have promise, with an asymmetric ratio of greater than 10,000 at +/-1 V, relatively high non-linearity and relatively good responsivity. On the other hand, as expected, the Nb/Nb2O5/Nb system yielded a symmetric I-V response. Based on this survey, the potential MIM systems (Nb/Nb2O5/Au and Pt) for future high frequency studies are identified. (1) Periasamy, P., et al., Adv Mater 2011, 23, 3080-3085.\n",

      "Failed to extract keywords for line: 9:00 AM - G4.16 Towards a Factory for Infinity Raymond  Oliver 1  Alexander Louis Bone 1  Oliver  Poyntz 1  1Northumbria University London United KingdomShow AbstractTo be competitive in the 21st Century on a global basis, manufacturing technologies have to demonstrate low cost, low inventory, high functionality, high added value product flexibility and be amendable and agile enough to work in both societal (concerns driven) and commercial (opportunities driven) environments. This paper focuses on the rate at which we consume and waste material and how therefore we can use lean manufacturing to create the lowest possible energy-materials cycles. We examine additive technologies, rapid prototyping and 3D printing/extrusion, self assembly materials (SAMs) and directed assembly materials (DAMs) as well as ambient processing on a local scale, going against the 20th Century view of ‘heat, beat and treat&’ where we overwhelm materials with energy until the materials succumb to our designs. The Factory for Infinity is the foundation for future factories, supporting an ideal system for consumption of products. Using only 100% recyclable (no ‘downcycling&’) or truly biodegradable materials, we have designed a system of low energy, small scale manufacturing processes that require old products to make new ones, allowing materials to be recycled infinitely in a local, closed loop cycle. This project led to the coining of the term ‘Disassembly is Manufacture&’ , a phrase which epitomises the ethos and ideals of this vision. The pursuit of this ideal vision lead the research team to the repurposing of techniques used within the extractive sector to enable new recycling systems and technologies. In practical terms experiments were conducted in two major sectors - zero waste, low energy metals remanufacture; by taking waste metals, dissolving them into an acid solution then precisely printing specific metals out of solution directly into new product; and rapid growth bio-materials; where microbials assist in new bio composites. The outcomes of this research were 3 sample products which exemplify current consumption. The Copper Bottle Filling discarded, one-use plastic bottles with frozen water; we melted forms that people would keep for much longer. We used electroforming from copper e-waste and lined the inside of the bottle with an antibacterial film of silver. The Glass keyboard The keyboard was selected as it is considered to be a device with a limited life expectancy, soon to be made obsolete by a variety of new types of input device. Having a short life expectancy it seemed an excellent product to display the qualities of the factory for infinities methodology. The Lamp Mycelium bond together local crop waste to form a light, fire-retardant, fully compostable material. The material is grown around the electronic components. A hazel neck and recycled glass printed with copper from e-waste complete the circuit.\n",

We have demonstrated a high-efficient bulk-heterojunction solar cell based on liquid crystalline phthalocyanine, 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octaoctylphthalocyanines (C6PcH2), exhibiting a high carrier drift mobility in excess of 1 cm2/Vs. The device can be fabricated through a spin-coating process from the blend solution of C6PcH2 and 1-(3-methoxy-carbonyl)- propyl-1-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM). For the formation of the optimally phase-separated nano-structure for efficient carrier generation and transportation, the mesogenic properties should play an important role. Solar cells have demonstrated a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) above 60% in the Q-band absorption region of C6PcH2, a high open circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.8V and a high energy conversion efficiency of 3.8%. The tandem organic thin-film solar cell has also been studied by utilizing active layer materials of C6PcH2 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a high Voc of 1.27 V has been achieved. C6PcH2 is also available as a dopant for conventional organic thin-film solar cells with a bulk hetero-junction active layer composed of P3HT and PCBM. The improvement of long-wavelength sensitivity in P3HT:PCBM bulk hetero-junction solar cells (EQE>40% in the wavelength range of 650-750nm) has been achieved by doping C6PcH2. The molecular alignment has also been investigated in this mesogen. The coexistence of different molecular packing of C6PcH2 with different electronic states has been observed in a planarly aligned sandwich cell.\n",

Generated excitons diffuse toward donor-acceptor interfaces where they are disassociated into free electrons and holes, a crucial step in the operation of organic solar cells. An important limitation in this process is the short exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors, which is on the order of 3-10 nm. If the donor and the acceptor domains are large, there is a high probability for excitons to relax back down to the ground state before reaching a donor-acceptor interface. Thus, it is important to know exciton diffusion lengths and to understand the influence of chemical structure. Several methods have been reported to measure exciton diffusion lengths by different groups on various materials, but it is unclear which method is more reliable. To resolve this issue, we selected test small molecule materials based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core, and measure exciton diffusion using four different methods and compare results obtained from these methods. The impact of chemical structure on the exciton diffusion length is also probed for a series of solution processed small molecules used as donors in bulk heterojunction solar cells.\n",

Fisher 1  Hiroki  Moriwake 1  Yuichi  Ikuhara 3   1  Hideki  Oki 4  1Japan Fine Ceramics Center Nagoya Japan2East China Normal University Shanghai China3The University of Tokyo Tokyo Japan4Toyota Motor Corporation Susono JapanShow AbstractLithium-ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices due to its high energy density, lightweight design than other comparable battery technologies. LiMn2O4  spinel is expected as cathodic materials in lithium secondary batteries, and has an unique structure in which lithium ions are reversibly intercalated in the structures. For the application of all-solid-state batteries, multilayer thin films are requested to fabricate and it is important to control the microstructure of grains, interface structure, crystal orientation to provide the stable rechargeable properties. The crystal orientation and quality are influenced by the processing methods and the kind of substrate. In this study, LiMn2O4 thin films were deposited on the substrates by the chemical solution deposition method, and the interface structures were observed by HRTEM and Cs-corrected STEM. LiMn2O4  thin films were fabricated using [Li-Mn-O] metalorganic precursor solution. Ligand exchange reactions of the LiOCH(CH3) 2 and Mn(OC2 H4OC2 H4 ))x with 2-ethoxyethanol was proceeded and the prepared [Li-Mn-O] metalorganic precursor solution was coated on the Al2O3 (0001) substrate and the Au film on the Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Epitaxial LiMn2O4  thin film was synthesized by heating the film at elevating temperature. The prepared samples were analyzed using a Cs-corrected STEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL Ltd) operated at 200 kV with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector.Cross-sectional HRTEM image of the interface between LiMn2O4  and Al2O3 , LiMn2O4  and Au film on Al2O3 substrate showed that the interface orientation relationship are as follows; (111)LiMn2O4  is parallel to (0001)Al2O3 , (111)LiMn2O4  is parallel to (111)Au which resulted in the (111)LiMn2O4  planes growing parallel to the surface plane of Al2O3 or Au (111) on Al2O3 substrates. In addition, HAADF-STEM observations revealed the connectivity of the respective cations across the interface.\n",

This interest comes from the high energy density coupled with the good open circuit voltages of those materials[1, 2]. Aside from these promising electrochemical performances, magnetic structures and physical properties of the 3d transition-metal-based materials have not been thoroughly studied yet. As demonstrated in our previous work, NaCoSO4F [3]; NaFeSO4F [3]; NaCoXO4F-2H2O [4] (X=S, Se) and LiFeSO4F [5] are constituted of one-dimensional chains of corner sharing MO4F2 octahedra linked through F atoms. Their magnetic susceptibility and low-temperature neutron diffraction show that they establish a G-type antiferromagnetic ground state for TN<40K. In the present work, we extend the investigations to the recently reported fluorine free Li2Co(SO4)2 and Li2Fe(SO4)2 [6] as well as to new potassium-based (KFeSO4F; KCoSO4F; KNiSO4F) electrode materials. The latter is of major interest as, unlike the Na or Li counterparts, it does not crystallize in the tavorite, sillimanite or triplite structure but rather in the KTiOPO4 structure type, known for its ferroelectric properties.

Weitz 2  1KAIST Daejeon Republic of Korea2Harvard University Cambridge USAShow AbstractWe report a new microfluidic emulsification technique for production of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double-emulsion drops with an ultra-thin middle layer as templates for microcapsules. When two immiscible fluids flow through a single capillary channel, one fluid with lower affinity to the wall flows through the center of the channel without contacting the wall, while the other fluid flows along the wall. Such core-sheath flows can be emulsified into the third fluid in a capillary microfluidic device, leading to formation of double-emulsion drops consisting of a large core and an ultra-thin shell; the ultra-thin shell provides high degree of confinement of the core drops due to strong lubrication resistance along whole surface, making the double-emulsion drops highly stable. Therefore, by employing the double-emulsion drops with ultra-thin shell as templates, we can safely encapsulate any water-soluble materials into microcapsules with ultrathin membrane, without rupture of the templates, through solidification of middle phase. The solidification can be achieved by evaporation-induced consolidation of organic middle phase containing polymers; the membrane can be biocompatible and biodegradable by using polymers such as poly(lactic acid) or polycaprolactone. Therefore, we can achieve a long-term release of encapsulants from the capsules as the membrane slowly degrades by hydrolysis. In addition, doping of magnetic nanoparticles into the membrane renders the capsules magneto-responsive; this enables migration or concentration of the capsules upon application of external magnetic field. Moreover, the surface morphology of the membrane can be further tailored by using polymeric blends; selective removal of one polymer from the blends produces perforated membranes, providing selective permeability of encapsulants. Using modified designs of capillary microfluidic devices, multiple distinct materials can be separately encapsulated into the microcapsules with multiple compartments. For example, through parallelization of the core-sheath streams, two or more distinct innermost drops are covered by nonspherical envelop of middle layers; such drops can produce microcapsules with dumbbell or triangle structures. Therefore, the capsules can store and release multiple materials simultaneously, while avoiding their cross-contaminations. In addition, capsules-in-capsules structure can also encapsulate multiple materials; such hierarchical capsules can be prepared by quadruple-emulsion drops in elaborate microfluidic devices. Because rate of membrane degradation can be independently controlled for inner and outer membranes, the capsules-in-capsules structures enable controlled sequential release of multiple encapsulants in a programmed fashion. Such various functional microcapsules with ultra-thin membranes will provide new opportunity for practical biological delivery systems and microreactors.\n",

CEP has established an automated, high-throughput, in silico framework for the study of millions of potential candidate structures. The current project phase is focused on the relevant molecular properties of these candidates - for small molecule setups but also for polymer building blocks. We utilize first-principles quantum chemistry as well as ideas from cheminformatics, machine learning, and pattern recognition to characterize molecular motifs and assess their quality with respect to applications as electronic materials. In addition to finding specific structures with certain properties, it is the goal of CEP to illuminate and understand the structure-property relations in the domain of organic electronics. Such insights can open the door to a rational, systematic, and accelerated development of future high-performance materials. CEP is a large-scale investigation which utilizes the massive computational resource of IBM&’s World Community Grid (www.worldcommunitygrid.org). This cyberinfrastructure paradigm has already allowed us to characterize 8 million compounds of interest in about 100 million DFT calculations. The results are compiled and analyzed in an extensive reference database (CEPDB) and will be made available for public use shortly. Our presentation addresses the project organization and workflow, data mining, analysis, and scoring, as well as promising molecular motifs which have emerged from CEP so far. For the last point we stress our close interaction with experimentalist collaborators and the role of CEP as a community tool.\n",

Specifically, we study photovoltaics made from 1:1 blends of polyfluorene copolymers poly(9,9&’-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-(N,N&’-(4,butylphenyl))bis(N,N&’-phenyl-1,4-phenylene)diamine) (PFB) and poly(9,9&’-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT). We photooxidize these films in situ using 365 nm, 405 nm, and 455 nm illumination under ambient conditions, with the wavelengths chosen to preferentially excite the different components. During photodegradation, we observe a faster loss of photocurrent generation from F8BT-rich domains, leaving the PFB-rich phases to show higher photoresponse than the F8BT-rich phases, even at wavelengths absorbed predominantly by F8BT. We attribute this effect to the more rapid degradation of PFB pathways in the F8BT-rich regions, resulting in a loss of percolation pathways for hole transport in the F8BT-rich phase. We test this hypothesis using ATR-FTIR and local hole mobility measurements taken before and after photooxidation.\n",

Recently, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting of multiple polymer solutions with a side-by-side geometry has been used for synthesis of anisotropic structures. While anisotropic structures of synthetic polymer-based biomaterials have been burgeoning, there have been very limited studies on anisotropic polypeptide nanostructures for in vivo applications. We are specifically interested in environmentally-responsive elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) derived from the tropoelastin because they undergo an inverse phase transition in aqueous conditions at a specific temperature (Tt) called as lower critical solution temperature (LCST). ELPs are highly soluble in an aqueous solution below Tt while being desolvated and becoming insoluble above Tt in a completely reversible way. In this study, we first report a facile method to prepare a new class of anisotropic ELP nanoparticles with environmental responsiveness by spontaneous structure transformation of biphasic ELP nanofiber architecture. Rationally designed ELP diblock copolymers composed of crosslinkable- and uncrosslinkable block were genetically engineered by recursive directional ligation for concatemerization, over-expressed by E. coli with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 24 hours, and purified by inverse transition cycling. Acrylic moieties were incorporated into the crosslinkable block of ELP diblock copolymers by using methacrylic anhydride for selective chemical crosslinking. The biphasic ELP nanofibers composed of acrylated ELP diblock copolymers were synthesized by organic solvent-based EHD co-jetting to prevent aggregation of ELP blocks during solvent evaporation, and then chemically stabilized via UV irradiation in the presence of a photoinitiator. Finally, when incubated in aqueous conditions, the biphasic ELP nanofibers were spontaneously disintegrated and then stabilized into the anisotropic ELP nanoparticles, potentially due to dissolution of the uncrosslinked block and equilibrium of the selectively crosslinked block. Therefore, anisotropic ELP nanoparticles formed by spontaneous structure transformation of biphasic ELP nanofibers were stable in dry and swollen state while maintaining distinct two compartments with environmental responsiveness, determined by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. It suggests that rationally designed ELP block architecture and composition precisely controlled at a genetic level could be useful to create multifunctional polypeptide nanostructures formed by spontaneous structure transformation. Conceptually, this study could establish a facile method to prepare anisotropic polypeptide nanoparticles for smart drug delivery system and molecular imaging.\n",

Although the primary sequences of the individual proteins define their governing interactions, their functions depend on the quaternary architecture that emerges from self-assembly. Proteins that naturally self-assemble into extended structures of oligomers with long-range order often adopt conformations that are distinct from those of the individual monomeric protein. When individual proteins fold from an unstructured state to the final stable state, the concept of a folding funnel with kinetic traps, in which the protein exhibits non-equilibrium structures for extended period of time, is used to describe the pathway. Unfortunately, these transient states are difficult to observe at the single molecular level largely due to the limitations of spatial resolution of conventional optical techniques. Consequently, detailed information about the dynamics and energetics of protein collapsing down the folding funnel is limited. Despite the fact that folding transformations are part and parcel of protein self-assembly, this concept of the folding funnel has not been considered in that context. Here, we investigate the connection between these two phenomena and explore the dynamics and energetics of folding transformations by utilizing the inherent single molecule resolution of in situ AFM to follow 2D crystallization of S-layers on atomically flat mica surfaces at molecular-scale. We demonstrate the emergence of binary states of S-layer organization in 2D. We find this system possesses a kinetic trap associated with a conformational difference between a long-lived transient state and the final stable state. Both ordered tetrameric states emerge from clusters of an amorphous precursor phase, however, they then track along two different pathways. Over time, we show that the trapped state transforms into the stable state. By analyzing the time and temperature dependencies of formation and transformation, we find that the energy barriers to formation of either state are quite similar, differing by a mere ~1.6 kJ/mol. However, once the higher energy state forms, the barrier to transformation to the lower energy state is much larger at ~61 kJ/mol, leading to the slow transformation process. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the importance of kinetic traps in determining the pathway of S-layer crystallization and suggest that the concept of the folding funnel for individual proteins can be equally applied to assembly of extended protein superstructures.\n",

However, some challenges remain before this technology can be used for industrial applications. These include reproducibility, morphology control, and enhancing the kinetics of self-assembly. In bulk BCP systems, the equilibrium morphology (cylinders, spheres, etc.) is determined by the volume fraction of the blocks. For lithographic applications, it is useful to vary the morphology that can be produced from a given polymer to increase the complexity of patterns it can generate. Solvent annealing can vary the morphology by selectively swelling the blocks, but it is commonly done at room temperatures and the annealing can take hours. We report self-assembly rate and morphology control using a custom built thermosolvent annealing system where multiple solvent vapor streams are controlled via mass flow controllers (0-10 sccm), and flowed into an annealing chamber (quartz, 80cm^3) containing the samples, which are placed on a resistive silicon nitride stage where temperatures are rapidly (< 1 min) controlled between 25 - 250 °C, and the film thickness is measured in situ using spectral reflectometry. The system investigated is thin films (30-70 nm) of cylinder forming poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-PDMS, segmental Flory-Huggins interaction parameter=0.26, f_PDMS = 0.32) with a molecular weight of 45 kg/mol, exposed to different vapor conditions of toluene and heptane while being rapidly heated to different temperatures. Morphology and rate behavior is tracked by utilizing spectral reflectometry (270-1500 nm) followed by observation of the PDMS morphology after selectively etching the PS with an oxygen plasma (50 W O2) with the intention of producing complex cylindrical patterns in minutes. In addition to films on smooth substrates, thermosolvent annealing of films on patterned substrates is described. The templates consist of arrays of posts made by exposure of hydroxyl silsesquioxane (38 nm thick) with an ELS-F125 e-beam lithography system and subsequently functionalized with a PS or PDMS brush [Nature Nanotechnology 5 256 (2010), Science 336 1294 (2012)]. The combination of thermosolvent annealing and nanoscale post templating allows for complex nanoscale patterns to be generated rapidly for lithographic applications. Both experimental results of the morphology vs temperature and solvent vapor pressures, and self-consistent field theory modeling using a monatomic fluid partition function representation of solvents are described.\n",

Here we present magnetic field directed self-assembly of two distinct cylinder forming liquid crystalline block copolymer materials where the minority blocks are amenable to selective removal or etching. The first system forms a weakly segregated acid-cleavable poly(ethylene oxide-b-methyl acrylate) EO-b-MA/LC block copolymer, where the methyl acrylate block has been side functionalized by a ciano-biphenyl mesogen. The second system is a strongly segregated brush block copolymer material with polynorbonene backbone where PLA brush forms the minority phase and a ciano-biphenyl species forms the liquid crystalline block (NBPLA-b-NBLC). For the EO-b-MA/LC system, due to high molecular weight (30K) the magnetic field displays a weak effect as judged from the in-situ SAXS, while the brush system was not susceptible to magnetic field alignment due to large separation of LC clearing transition and order-disorder transition temperatures. Surprisingly, addition of a small amount of free ciano-biphenyl mesogens induces strong and fast alignment of microdomains of these materials under 6T magnetic field. The minority domains are subsequently cleaved or etched away from the aligned block copolymers by chemical means generating highly aligned nanoporous materials which could potentially serve as templates for the synthesis of nanomaterials. Magnetic field assisted alignment thus offer a facile route of controlling porosity, dimension and aspect ratios by changing the molecular weight and the thickness of these block copolymer systems .\n",

There is a growing field in assembling these nanoparticles into more complex structures, analogous to assemblies demonstrated in Nature such as formation of virus capsids or amyloid fibers from small protein aggregates. A key factor in achieving such complex self-assembled structures as demonstrated in Nature is the use of anisotropic or chiral compounds as building blocks in biological systems. To mimic such assemblies, it is important to be able to synthesize asymmetric nanoparticle building blocks. However, syntheses of these type of particles are still limited and of great challenge. Precedent reports in using asymmetrical deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)-particle hybrids have demonstrated some success in attaining programmable assemblies. Hence, to address the current barrier to create complex and programmable assemblies, we here report a facile and efficient method to synthesize nanoparticles with precise control of anisotropicity and programmable functionality (i.e. specific and localized functionalization of DNA). This one-pot colloidal method relies on ligand competition to introduce anisotropicity on gold nanoparticles in a tunable manner with excellent yields. The selectivity of the assembly can be controlled by selective functionalization of the particle with DNA strands. We have demonstrated (1) the successful DNA-aided synthesis of anisotropic NPs with high yield, (2) site selective functionalization with DNA where only a specific area of the particle is functionalized (3) high density of DNA functionalization with 120 ± 20 strands regioselectively functionalized on each particle, (4) controllable directional hybridization of the nanoparticle to form programmable assemblies of various combinations of particles into clusters, dimers, snowman, dog paw and flower like assemblies. With high yields and ease of the synthesis of anisotropically functionalized nanoparticle, we believe this method would revolutionize the nanoparticle field to explore anisotropic and selective assemblies. Due to the unique structural features of the anisotropic nanoparticle, the specificity and programmability would be promising platforms in the nanoassembly field to perform even more complex assemblies in a bottom up manner bringing us a step closer to the system achieved in Nature.\n",

Intel remains on a 2 year technology cycle, having started production of 22nm HVM in 2011, and is actively working to enable 14nm and beyond. While technology advancement and innovation in patterning for 22 and 14nm nodes has come mainly from innovative materials selection and processing steps involved in PD and computational lithography, it will be highly beneficial to complement existing lithography and advanced PD technologies with patterning solutions having inherently higher resolution than ArFi for the 10nm and beyond nodes. EUV and EBDW lithography promise to reduce wafer cost through combining multiple ArFi patterning steps on a given layer into one, yet as HVM insertion date for those keeps moving forward limitations imposed by shot noise on resist sensitivity and consequently on tools throughput might limit minimal size of features patterned by those techniques in a single exposure or single pass. Directed Self Assembly have potential to allow further scaling of minimal dimensions as well as dimensions variability rectification to extend scalability of shot noise limited feature dimensions produced by either EUV or EBDW. Templated Self Assembly has potential to complement 193nm immersion patterning to allow scaling of features down to sub-10nm dimensions. The presentation will offer the author&’s opinion on the prospects, challenges and complementary nature for EUV, EBDW and DSA insertion in logic HVM for 10nm and beyond.\n",

Already the method is allowing the creation of long-range ordered periodic patterns of dots and lines required for the fabrication of various memory and logic devices. However, creation of aperiodic structures using appropriate templating while avoiding defect formation remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate the use of a hybrid Monte Carlo (MC) and self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulation to solve the inverse problem of BCP directed self-assembly, i.e. to determine the template necessary for directing the self-assembly of a diBCP to form a target geometry. This method is in contrast to the traditional use of SCFT to determine the microdomain morphology that is directed by a given template. In the model, the template features are assumed to be topographical structures such as hydrogen silsequioxane (HSQ) posts fabricated using electron beam lithography. These features are modeled using a large hard wall pressure field that constrains the BCP field density to not occupy that space in the simulation grid. The diBCP modeling parameters such as chi;, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, N, the degree of polymerization, and f, the minority component volume fraction are selected to match cylindrical forming poly(styrene-b-polydimethylsiloxane) (PS-PDMS) used in experiments. The posts in the model can be attractive to either the majority or the minority block. By first designing the final desired fields of the polymer system and using those field values as the initial state of the simulation, various spatial configurations of a given number of template posts are examined through a MC process using the standard field based Hamiltonian of SCFT. This process is iterated until an energy minimum configuration template for the desired input structure is found. For some metastable structures where multiple post configurations may yield the same final structure, the MC scheme is iterated many times with the resulting post configurations being averaged to make a probable template. This template is tested computationally by performing a normal SCFT simulation comparing the resulting field morphology with the input fields and experimentally by preparing a PS-PDMS thin film on an HSQ template. Various components of interest such as bends, three-way junctions, terminals, and connector holes combined in various layouts are used as input structures to demonstrate the capabilities of the simulations with the resulting patterns compared to the input structure. For example, we showed that six minority-block-coated post features could template the formation of a terminal connected to a three-way junction structure from a cylinder-forming BCP. These results thus provide an inverse design process for directed self-assembly of BCPs to form arbitrary pattern features.\n",

We describe here a coalition of fabrication protocols that employ block copolymer self-assembly and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) to obtain metal oxide and metal nanopatterns with sub-100 nm spatial resolution. The protocols are easily scalable down to sub-50 nm and below. Nanopatterned arrays of ZnO created by a top down approach using NIL assisted templates through area selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) and radio frequency (rf) sputtering find application in NVM and photovoltaics. We have employed NIL that produced nanoporous polymer templates for pattern transfer into ZnO, using Si molds derived from block copolymer lithography. The resulting ZnO nanoarrays were highly dense (8.6 x 109 nanofeatures per cm2) exhibiting periodic feature to feature spacing and width resembling the geometric attributes of the template. We have produced highly tunable polymer templates by block copolymer self assembly - a bottom-up approach - to realize metal and metal oxides nanopatterns. The positively charged self assembled nanopatterns of diblock copolymer reverse micelles directed the electrostatic self-assembly of citrate stabilized Au nanoparticles. When the same templates were exposed to ALD cycles to deposit ZnO, the zinc precursor selectively decomposed within the micelle core producing ZnO nanopatterns. The resulting metal and metal oxide nanopatterns showed excellent registry with the self assembled micelle patterns in pitch and periodicity. Consequently, tunability was achieved by optimizing the self assembly process. Such nanopatterns find application in NVM, where a change in the density and periodicity of the arrays influences the charge storage characteristics and also in biomolecular detection when the geometric attributes of the arrays influence the plasmonics properties crucial to sensing. As a case study, the above assembly and patterning protocols were employed to fabricate MOS and MIS capacitor devices for investigating application in NVM. Patterned ZnO and Au nanoparticle arrays were used as charge storage centres for the MOS and MIS devices, respectively. Preliminary results upon investigating the flash memory performance showed good flat-band voltage hysteresis window at a relatively low operating voltage due to high charge trap density The novelty of our patterning protocol and the retention of the charges by overcoming back-tunnelling and lateral conduction is particularly significant in view of the thin tunnelling oxide (3 nm) employed in the device.\n",

Dayto USA3National Research Council Washington USA4Rice University Houston USAShow AbstractChiral-selective growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) remains a great challenge that hinders their use in applications such as electronics and medicine. Recent experimental and theoretical reports have begun to address this problem by suggesting that selectivity may be achieved during nucleation by changing the catalyst composition or structure. Nevertheless, to establish a rational basis for chiral-selective synthesis, the underlying mechanisms governing nucleation, growth, and termination of SWNTs must be better understood. To this end, we report the first measurements of growth rates of individual SWNTs through in situ Raman spectroscopy and correlate them with their chiral angles. Our results show that the growth rates are directly proportional to the chiral angles, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Importantly, the evidence singles out the growth stage as responsible for the chiral distribution— distinct from nucleation and termination which might also affect the final product distribution. Our results suggest a route to chiral-selective synthesis of SWNTs through rational synthetic design strategies based on kinetic control.\n",

Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights USAShow AbstractSingle-walled carbon nanotubes are a leading candidate to replace silicon as the active channel in future (sub-10nm technology node) logic devices. As the sub-10nm technology node will contain billions of transistors, sorting carbon nanotubes to several 9&’s purity is critical for the integration of the material. Column chromatography is employed to separate semiconducting from metallic carbon nanotubes with a purity of 99.5%. The process proceeds using a single surfactant; where both the metallic and semiconducting bands resolve and elute using the same surfactant system. This is a key advantage of this method as it allows for iterative processing and high levels of purity. The effect of the pore size of the column media was evaluated and found to have a large effect on the quality of the separation. Additionally, varying the pore-size demonstrates that both size-exclusion and selective adsorption play a role in the columns ability to resolve the carbon nanotubes by electronic type. Absorption spectroscopy was used to optically characterize the carbon nanotube solutions and evaluate the level of purity. After two iterations of chromatography, the metallic peaks (M11 transition) in the absorption spectra were completely attenuated making it difficult to quantify the level of purity for solutions where multiple iterations were performed. In order to quantify the purity level, a high throughput electrical testing method was developed. Several thousand short channel (~150nm) devices were fabricated where individual SWCNTs span the source and drain. The devices were measured using a semi-automated probe station and the number of semiconducting and metallic devices were simply counted. A semiconducting yield of 99.5 ± 0.2 % was achieved after the separation process. In addition to devices that employ a single CNT, thin-film transistors employing many, separated CNTs were also fabricated and tested. The devices employ varying channel lengths (1um to 80um) and widths (5um to 100um) on both flexible, plastic substrates and rigid, silicon substrates. As expected and indicative of the purity, trade-offs between channel length and Ion/Ioff and transconductance were observed. In both cases, local bottom gates where employed to avoid the need to grow dielectrics directly on the carbon nanotubes, allowing for the employment of thin (down to 10nm), high quality dielectrics. The devices exhibited excellent transport properties for TFTs with Ion/Ioff ratios of 106 and field-effect mobilities of ~ 20 cm2V-1s-1. The rigid substrates that employed 10nm HfO2/W embedded gates showed especially low subthreshold slopes of ~ 200 mv/dec. Generally speaking, the separation method described here allows for the isolation of high purity semiconducting CNTs for applications in thin-film technologies and provides one possible path forward to the extremely high purities necessary for high performance logic.\n",

They were solution cast as thin films and characterized using various analytical tools to investigate hierarchical defects evolution much below threshold. This work is a summary of our recent work [Gupta et al. J. Appl. Phys. 107 (2010) and Gupta et al. J. Appl. Phys. 106 (2009)] where radiation-induced microscopic defects seem to be stabilized by UDD, especially in the case of SWCNTs as compared with MWCNTs when subjected to the maximum irradiation dose. Quantitative analyses of multi-wavelength Raman spectra assessed through variation in the prominent D, G and 2D Raman bands elucidated radiation-induced microscopic defects. A minimal change in the position of D, G and 2D bands and a marginal increase in intensity of the defect induced double resonant D band and Raman active 2D band are some of the implications suggesting combined radiation coupling and resilience. The in-plane correlation length (La) was also determined following TK relation from the ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) besides microscopic stress/strain. Moreover, we also suggest the following taking into account of intrinsic defects of the constituents: a) charge transfer arising at the interface due to the difference in electro-negativity of CNT C-sp2 and UDD core (C-sp3) leading to phonon and electron energy renormalization; b) mis-orientation of C-sp2 at the interface of MWCNT and UDD shell (C-sp2) resulting in structural disorder; c) softening or violation of the q ~ 0 selection rule leading to D band broadening and a minimal change in G band intensity; and d) normalized intensity of D and G bands with 2D band help to distinguish defect-induced double resonance phenomena. Furthermore, an attempt was made to identify the nature of defects (charged versus residual) and it seemed the electrical properties were more labile to irradiation than structural properties. This work was primarily conducted at the University of Missouri and MURR while the author (S.G.) was working there.\n",

Harutyunyan 1  1Honda Research Institute USA Inc. Columbus USAShow AbstractThe advance of nanotechnology has opened new opportunities to develop ever more sensitive sensors. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) is one of the most exciting materials in this regard due to its high surface-to-volume ratio and unique electronic structure. Ironically the ultrahigh sensitivity of SWNTs can be easily compromised by contaminations from the environment. Indeed, here we show that despite significant progress has been made in the last decade, we are still nowhere close to what a pristine SWNT based sensor can potentially offer [1]. Under continuous in situ ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, the electrical response of pristine SWNTs becomes extremely sensitive to gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide with a detection limit as low as 590 parts-per-quadrillion at room temperature. Gas sensing on NO2 and NH3 further confirmed that pristine nanotubes could have sensitivities orders of magnitude better than what previously had achieved. In addition, we observed the electrical response to reverse its direction upon NH3 exposure after applying in situ UV light illumination, which clearly explains the origin of ultrasensitivity reported here. Aiming for practical applications, we further illustrate how to address gas selectivity by introducing a gate bias. Because of its simplicity the concept of in situ cleaning can be deployed in existing sensor architectures. [1] Chen, G.; Paronyan, T. M.; Pigos, E. M.; Harutyunyan, A.

In a suitable environment and at high enough temperature, the nanotubes can be synthesised with fast growth rate, resulting in the formation of macroscopic aerogel, which then is condensed into a fibre in a continuous process. The determining factor for the properties of this fibre is the intrinsic CNT morphology. We have been developing strategies to control this structure in a floating catalyst CVD reaction by controlling reaction dynamics and optimising the catalyst structure. Different from the method commonly used, where a sulphur promoter precursor is added to enhance the CNT rate of formation by chemical bonding with the catalyst particles, we propose a new strategy to control the chemistry of the reaction. A significant reduction in defects of the fibre microstructure and control over the morphology of the CNTs building up the fibre can be attained without any promoter addition but by careful selection of suitable carbon precursor structures. The pyrolization temperatures are critical to enable control over the reaction dynamics and formation of desirable nanostructure of the CNT fibre. Furthermore the fibre has very low amount of impurities remaining at approximately 0.2 wt% level, corresponding to the iron catalyst used during the synthesis process, which could be completely removed, if needed using a simple purification method. The effect of varied reaction temperature and other reaction parameters was determined by comprehensive characterization using SEM, TEM, TGA, FIB and Raman spectroscopy. High resolution TEM combined with Raman spectroscopy revealed the production of single wall nanotubes with no presence of carbon based impurities, typically observed by others on the surface of carbon nanotubes. Finally, a high level of structural perfection of individual nanotubes was achieved with D/G intensity ratio as low as 0.03 with practically none existing D peak in the Raman spectrum.\n",

The procedure started by making integrated sensing electrodes and microheaters by lithography as sensor platform. Then, CuO nanostructures as sensing material were synthesized selectively by local heating directly on top of sensing electrodes. The simple hydrothermal reaction occurred at relatively low temperature and resulted in uniform, high-density networks of spike-like nanostructures of CuO over the heated area. Each individual spike has base width (sim;300 nm) and length (sim;700 nm) tapering to sharp tips. The material characteristics of synthesized CuO nanostructures were analyzed by XPS and EDS. Based on the XPS spectra, initial structure consisted of CuO and Cu2O. After annealing at elevated temperature (300°C), the structures were converted to fully oxidized CuO. Also, two dominant peaks were observed as Cu and O element with no observable impurities through EDS spectra. In order to study the material growth process, we varied growth time from 0.5 to 10 min. It was found that 5 min growth time gave optimum sensing performances. Interestingly, high sensitivity (ΔR/R = 159 %) and fast response (tau; sim; 200 s) were measured by exposing 9.4 ppm of H2S gas at room temperature. Then, the sensors were tested to H2S environment with concentration ranging from 9.4 ppm down to 600 ppb. Sensor showed responses of ΔR/R= 74, 56, 40, 22, and 8% when gas concentration was varied as 9.4, 6.3, 3.13, 1, and 0.6 ppm, respectively. Good response and recoverability were recorded. Furthermore, a linear curve of response vs. concentrations (1 - 9.4 ppm) was obtained in logarithmic plot. This suggested the oxygen molecule adsorption/desorption on CuO surface as the sensing mechanism. The stability of sensor was studied by continuous monitoring over 24 hours in room temperature and elevated temperature using ambient atmosphere, and no sensor degradation was observed. We also found that at higher temperature (T > 60°C), CuS layer was formed on the surface of CuO caused the irreversible drop of resistance and increased surface roughness. The CuS formation was confirmed by XPS. CuS has natural metallic behaviour that acts as electrical pathway on the CuO surface and reduces the resistance.\n",

Although individual metal-oxide NPs have tremendous application potential in many technological areas (catalysis, magnetism, electronics etc.), their low surface area and tendency for clustering limit the applicability of these nanomaterials, especially in adsorption and catalysis. Three-dimensional NP assemblies with well-connected nanopores running through them promise a different kind of porous materials with advantageous characteristics. These materials are expected to achieve excellent catalytic and optoelectronic properties and yet possess additional characteristics such as size-selective adsorption and molecular recognition of substrate. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a very important material for photocatalysis, photovoltaic, and electrochromic applications owing to its unique photocatalytic and opto-electronic properties. Recent efforts to improve photocatalytic performance have been focused on synthesis of nanometer-sized TiO2 particles, which possess high crystallinity and large surface area. Generally, the surfactant-assisted post-synthesis aggregation route is proven to be effective in creating porous assemblies from nanoparticles. Following this approach, several organic amphiphilic molecules, like charged small molecules and block or graft copolymers, have been used as templates to direct the assembly of titanium precursors or pre-synthesized TiO2 nanocrystals into mesostructured ensembles. However, the synthesis of high-surface-area mesoporous assemblies from nanocrystalline TiO2 is not obvious. In this work, we report a facile synthesis of high surface area, high crystalline, nanostructured titania via a surfactant-assisted self-assembly of anatase TiO2 NPs. The synthesis accomplished in one-step chemical process in which the crystallization and assembly of TiO2 NPs into three-dimensional assembled structures takes place. The obtained mesostructure consists of interconnected spherical NPs (ca. 8 nm) and exhibits large and accessible pore surface (ca. 156 m2/g), as evidenced by XRD, SAXS, TEM and N2 physisorption measurements. Interestingly, control of the experimental conditions such as template and time of polymerization greatly affects the structural properties (i.e. pore width, surface area, and nanoparticle diameter) of the resulting materials. We also demonstrate that this synthetic method can be used for producing mesoporous heteroaggregates from CdS and TiO2 NPs as efficient visible light photocatalysts. These TiO2 mesophases have been used under UV-visible light to photocatalyse the O2-mediated oxidation of 1-phenyethanol, showing high reactivity and stability.\n",

In most of the reported Ge waveguide photodetectors, Ge was grown selectively on a Si followed by post-growth annealing to reduce the dislocation density. However, the effect of the post-growth annealing in selectively-grown Ge mesas was not well known, because Ge was generally grown thicker than the target value for planarization of Ge with a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In this study, we report the reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) Ge selective epitaxial growth for waveguide photodetectors which do not require CMP process, and the effect of post-growth annealing conditions on the shape transition and tensile strain. 1um-thick Ge samples were selectively grown on (100) silicon rib waveguides opened through SiO2 masks with the three-step growth, consisting of a low-temperature (384°C) seed layer, ramp layer deposited during temperature transition (384°C~650°C), and high- temperature (650°C) cap layer. The samples were annealed in the RPCVD chamber right after the Ge growth by heating up to 750°C or 875°C with different annealing conditions. Besides reduction of the threading dislocation density, the subsequent post-growth annealing resulted in structural deformations in all samples. The selectively as-grown Ge mesa had a (100) surface with {111} and {311} sidewall facets. After annealing in RPCVD chamber, the mesas were deformed into a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape of a narrowed (100) top surface and widened {311} side wall facets, with disapearing {111} sidewall facets. This resulting facet change could be explained by minimization of both the surface energy and the strain energy. To study the relationship of the shape transition to the strain in Ge mesas, Micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed for measurements of the residual strain. Here, we present the results on our investigation of composition, strain and intentionally introduced crystalline reordering in thin Ge selectively-grown on Si using micro-Raman spectroscopy.\n",

SiGe NWs were grown by the Vapour-Liquid-Solid method using a LPCVD reactor, Si2H6 and GeH4 as precursor gases for Si and Ge respectively and Ga-Au metallizations of different compositions as catalysts. The Ge fraction of the NWs, in the 0 - 0.15 range, was controlled by the gas flow ratio and the growth temperature. The NWs were separated from the substrate by sonication and collected in a methanol bath for their analysis. The NWs were structurally characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy, revealing an overall good crystalline quality, with a cubic diamond structure and no defects. In some of the NWs analyzed, localized regions with wurtzite structure as well as arrays of stacking faults along the main NW axis are observed. A microRaman spectrometer was used for the optical characterization of the NWs. A drop of methanol containing NWs was deposited onto a thick Al film evaporated on top of a Si wafer. The NWs were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and located. Raman maps were subsequently obtained in the selected single NWs. The intensity of the Raman signal arising from the individual NWs was found to be high enough to allow their detailed analysis. The Raman maps reveal the presence of NWs zones with ordered polytypes, in particular the wurtzite 2H polytype. The NWs composition homogeneity, the formation of the wurtzite phase, the influence of the composition of the catalyst and the possible causes of the high intensity of the Raman signal are discussed.\n",

To utilize NWs within these technologies, it is essential to optimize the growth of In1-xGaxAs NWs comprising high uniformity in terms of composition, structure, and site-selectivity. Here, recent insights into growth, microstructural and optical properties of self-induced, catalyst-free In1-xGaxAs NW arrays on Si (111) substrate are reported. Using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) for large-scale pre-patterned SiO2/Si (111) templates and subsequent high-purity molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we realized the spontaneous non-catalytic growth of well-alignedIn1-xGaxAs NWs was realized with very high-yield (> 90%) and pristine non-tapered morphological homogeneity [1]. Several material and physical properties, as composition and structure, were investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), photoluminescence (PL) and µ-Raman spectroscopy. Based on careful growth optimization we first demonstrate that for the composition-tuned In1-xGaxAs NW arrays the Ga content can be varied over a large band gap region (0.4-1.4 eV), while surprisingly emission (PL) linewidths remain largely unmodified. This remarkable finding points to the superiority of site-selective growth (SAG) on NIL- SiO2/Si (111) substrates giving very low degree of phase separation, as confirmed by STEM and EDX. In contrast, self-assembled, spatially uncorrelated In1-xGaxAs NW arrays show larger compositional inhomonot;gennot;eity across the entire NW array with increased peakwidths in 2theta;minus;omega; HRXRD scans as well as broadened Raman modes [1]. Moreover, for both site-selective and self-assembled In1-xGaxAs NW arrays the alloy composition along the length of individual NWs was quite uniform as a result of the catalyst-free growth mode, surpassing well-known limitations of catalyst-driven growth. In addition, the structural properties of the In1-xGaxAs NWs were found to be very sensitive to the Ga content within a given set of growth conditions. While at low Ga content (<30%) the NW microstructure is predominated by wurtzite phase (WZ) with distinct segments and stacking defects, higher Ga content (70%) yielded higher degree of stacking disorder along the growth direction (intermixing of WZ and Zincblende (ZB) twins). These findings were confirmed by µ-Raman spectroscopy, which displays specific features such as scaling of phonon mode broadening and disorder-activated longitudinal optical (LO) and acoustical modes (DALA) in dependence of Ga content [2].

Scattergood 1  1NCSU Raleigh USAShow AbstractThermodynamic stabilization is achieved when segregation of solute atoms to grain boundaries produces a metastable equilibrium state with respect to grain growth. This has been proposed as a mechanism to stabilize a nanocrystalline grain size at high temperatures. Alternate stabilization mechanisms are based on retarding grain boundary mobility by grain boundary pinning (Zener pinning, etc.). The work presented here was motivated by the need to develop a predictive model for thermodynamic stabilization, applicable to strongly segregating solutes, that uses available input data. This will serve as a benchmark for selecting solutes and assessing the possible contribution of thermodynamic stabilization in the development of high-temperature nanocrystalline alloys. Following a regular solution model recently developed by Trelewicz and Schuh [1], the grain boundary region is distinguished from the grain interior region by a transitional interface. The elastic part of the enthalpy due to the solute atomic size misfit is not taken into account in [1] and we include this using the Wynblatt and Ku approximation [2] for linear superposition of the elastic and chemical contributions to the mixing enthalpy. It is important to recognize that the elastic term always contributes to segregation whereas the chemical term may contribute or detract. The total Gibbs free energy of mixing is minimized with respect to simultaneous variations in the grain-boundary content and the solute concentrations within the grain boundary and grain interior regions using the Lagrange multiplier method. The model predictions are presented as a parametric study of the key input variables. Applications to the temperature dependence of the grain size and solute segregation will be given for selected systems where experimental results suggest that thermodynamic stabilization can contribute. 1.

Recent studies on the microstructure of nc metals and alloys under various deformation conditions show that grain growth occurs in these types of materials when severely deformed. The simultaneous appearance of dislocations and GB processes needs special care in explaining the grain-growth behavior of nc materials during deformation. In our three earlier consecutive papers, it was shown that in a nanocrystalline Ni-18wt.%Fe alloy cold rolled either at room temperature (RT) or at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) the grain size increases, whereas the dislocation density and the twin boundary frequency decreases. Though all the results and discussions in these studies were sound and conclusive, the rolling conditions were rather simple and ad-hoc not taking into account the columnar grain shape or the initial texture of the starting material. In the as-deposited state, the material has a well defined <100> fiber texture normal to the plane of the electro-deposited sheet, where the long axes of the columnar grains are also along the same <100> directions. Rolling deformation can be carried out in many different directions relative to the directions of both, the texture and the long-axes of the columnar grains. In the present work we select two very different specimen orientations for determining the relevant changes of the sub-structure. In one specimen orientation, the normal-direction (ND) of rolling is identical to the <100> fiber texture direction. In the other specimen orientation, the ND direction is perpendicular to the <100> fiber direction. Our this systematic investigation shows that strong deformation reduces the average dislocation density and causes detwinning, especially if twins exist initially, however, the grain-growth depends strongly on the relative orientations between (i) the texture direction, (ii) the long-axes directions of the columnar grains and (iii) the ND of rolling. High energy X-rays are used, which can penetrate relatively thick specimens. The relatively small diffraction angles and the full Debye-Scherrer rings in the detector enable to evaluate the diffraction patterns corresponding to two perpendicular diffraction vector directions at the same time. The third direction of the diffraction vector is accessed by changing the specimen orientation in the diffractometer. This synchrotron technique is used to obtain size parameter values in three dimensions for bulk materials, without bothering the surface-microstructure relaxation from TEM thin foils.\n",

In order to integrate nanowires into such functional devices it is essential to fully understand nanowire mechanics, electrical characteristics, and how electrical transport evolves with an applied stress- the electromechanical response. There is a wide understanding of how to characterise nanowire mechanical and electrical properties [4-5], however measuring the electromechanical response has been hampered by the lack of reliable tools and systems. We have developed a reliable scanning probe measurement system that allows for dynamic characterisation of both mechanical and electrical properties. Utilising dual lateral atomic force microscopy and four probe electrical measurement, we have shown how resistance and resistivity evolve under an applied strain for penta-twinned silver nanowires (Ag NW&’s). A single suspended Ag NW is laterally loaded through the elastic and plastic regime in a three point bending geometry whilst obtaining the force-displacement curve, and 4-probe IV characteristics from a constant source voltage. We observed relative resistance increases of 7 % from 0 % - 100 % strain and resistivity increases up to 29 %. Resistance and resistivity changes may be attributed to increased surface scattering due to tensile elongation, although the exact mechanism is unclear at this time. Tensile elongation reduces the nanowires cross sectional area in accordance with Poisson&’s ratio. This lateral dimensional decrease perpendicular to the applied load means the effective nanowire diameter evolves as the nanowire bends, hence increasing surface scattering. This effect allows us to probe resistance changes above and below the electron mean free path. (References: 1.

They were solution cast as thin films and characterized using various analytical tools to investigate hierarchical defects evolution much below threshold. This work is a summary of our recent work [Gupta et al. J. Appl. Phys. 107 (2010) and Gupta et al. J. Appl. Phys. 106 (2009)] where radiation-induced microscopic defects seem to be stabilized by UDD, especially in the case of SWCNTs as compared with MWCNTs when subjected to the maximum irradiation dose. Quantitative analyses of multi-wavelength Raman spectra assessed through variation in the prominent D, G and 2D Raman bands elucidated radiation-induced microscopic defects. A minimal change in the position of D, G and 2D bands and a marginal increase in intensity of the defect induced double resonant D band and Raman active 2D band are some of the implications suggesting combined radiation coupling and resilience. The in-plane correlation length (La) was also determined following TK relation from the ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) besides microscopic stress/strain. Moreover, we also suggest the following taking into account of intrinsic defects of the constituents: a) charge transfer arising at the interface due to the difference in electro-negativity of CNT C-sp2 and UDD core (C-sp3) leading to phonon and electron energy renormalization; b) mis-orientation of C-sp2 at the interface of MWCNT and UDD shell (C-sp2) resulting in structural disorder; c) softening or violation of the q ~ 0 selection rule leading to D band broadening and a minimal change in G band intensity; and d) normalized intensity of D and G bands with 2D band help to distinguish defect-induced double resonance phenomena. Furthermore, an attempt was made to identify the nature of defects (charged versus residual) and it seemed the electrical properties were more labile to irradiation than structural properties. This work was primarily conducted at the University of Missouri and MURR while the author (S.G.) was working there.\n",

While this is necessary for industrial use to maximise the surface area and stability, a valuable basic science approach is to make the catalysts “as simple as possible, but not simpler” (A. Einstein). A class of compounds not often investigated in catalysis are intermetallic compounds, which differ strongly from substitutional alloys, since they possess crystal structures different from the constituent elements. The more complicated structures result from the partly covalent bonding within the compounds, which also enhances their stability leading to high stability under reaction conditions and reduced segregation. The structural changes and the bonding situation result in much stronger changes of the electronic structure compared to substitutional alloys. Combining the “as simple as possible, but not simpler” idea with the huge potential of the intermetallic compounds leads to their unsupported use in heterogeneous catalysis. Due to their large number (more than 10,000 binary intermetallic compounds are known and many more with more than two elements) this opens a vast matrix to explore relationships between electronic and crystal structure on the one hand and the catalytic properties on the other. Uncovering these relationships leads to a deep understanding and the gained knowledge can be used to select intermetallic compounds with optimised crystal and electronic structure in the next step. This is named the knowledge-based approach [1]. This approach has been successfully applied in the development of a new class of highly selective semi-hydrogenation catalysts based on Ga-Pd intermetallic compounds. These compounds represent the first example, where the knowledge-based approach was applied starting from the bulk materials, studying their stability under reaction conditions, developing an approach to unsupported nanoparticulate materials and inventing an industrially feasible route to highly active materials while preserving the selectivity and stability of the bulk compounds [2]. Due to the knowledge gained during the investigations, the Pd-based systems could finally be replaced by more ubiquitous non-noble metal based materials like Al13Fe4 [3]. [1] K. Kovnir, M.

The assessment supports SKB&’s licence application for a final repository for spent nuclear fuel at Forsmark. If groundwater enters a damaged canister and comes in contact with the spent fuel, radionuclides may be released into the water. If the aqueous concentration of an element reaches saturation with respect to the solid phase, then its solubility limit is attained and the element will precipitate. As a result, only the aqueous fraction of the element may migrate with the water flowing from the canister while the fraction that has precipitated remains in the canister. The key factors that affect the elemental solubility limits were identified as: 1) the assumed solubility limiting phase, 2) the geochemical conditions inside the damaged canister and 3) the thermodynamic database used. Solubility limiting phases were selected by an “expert judgement”, favouring phases that would be likely to precipitate without any kinetic restrictions. The geochemical conditions inside the damaged canister were assumed to be identical to the conditions in the groundwater with the exception that the redox conditions were controlled by the magnetite/goethite equilibrium. The thermodynamic database used was the Nagra/PSI Chemical Thermodynamic Data. To produce probability density functions for elemental solubilities, the Simple Functions tool was developed. Simple Functions performs geochemical equilibrium calculations, but contains only the limited subset of data and reactions that is needed to calculate solubilities for the conditions that can be expected at the Forsmark site. Simple Functions was used in combination with the @risk software to fast and efficiently produce the solubility data. The assessment in SR-Site covers 6 000 canister positions and the assessment period is one million years. This means that there will be a natural spatial and temporal variability in the composition of the groundwater. To handle this, the solubility limits for the safety assessment were calculated with a set consisting of 25% of groundwater compositions representing the temperate climate, 25% representing the permafrost climate, 25% representing glacial climate and 25% representing submerged climate. For the uncertainties in thermodynamic data a normal distribution was applied to the equilibrium constants (mu; = log10K0 and σ = (Δlog10K0) / 2). The relative importance of variability in groundwater composition compared to uncertainty in thermodynamic data was evaluated by keeping either the groundwater composition or the thermodynamic data constant. The results showed that uncertainty in thermodynamic data has a bigger impact on the results for almost every radioelement. The sole exception to this is radium, which happens to be the most safety critical element, where variability in water composition has a somewhat larger impact.\n",

It is a commercial mixture of a crystalline silicotitanate (CST) with the formula of (H3O)xNay(Nb0.3Ti0.7)4Si2O14#9679;zH2O - where x~2, y~1 and z~4, and a Zr(OH)4 binder. To manage the spent ion exchanger, hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) is being applied as a route for densifying and consolidating the materials to produce a monolithic wasteform prior to final disposal. In this study, IONSIV was firstly ion-exchanged in aqueous CsNO3 to yield Cs-IONSIV and then HIPed at 1100 °C for 2 hrs (190 MPa, Ar gas) within a mild steel can. During the HIP process, Cs-IONSIV was thermally decomposed and converted to two major Cs-containing phases, Cs2TiNb6O18 and Cs2ZrSi6O15, and a series of other phases. The microstructure and phase assemblage of the HIPed samples as a function of Cs content were examined using XRD, XRF, SEM, and TEM-EDX. The leaching and durability of HIPed IONSIV was also investigated using the MCC-1 and PCT-B standard test methods. These show very low Cs leach rates and the promise of safe long-term immobilisation of Cs from IONSIV as well as suggesting these phases are superior to hollandite - the material targeted for Cs sequestration in SYNROC.\n",

Dose rates of the released radioactive nuclides that made landfall on mainland Japan are largely controlled by the ground level contamination and accumulation of Cesium137 (Cs137) in populated areas. Elevated dose rates were recorded after the realease, but which have continued to decrease daily. Dose rates greater than 2.8 µSv/h were recorded in some parts of Fukushima-city in May 2011, located some 60 km NW of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, were considered to be unacceptable. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Japan approached the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to develop an immediate and effective method of reducing the dose rate received by students in Fukushima-city&’s school facilities. Selectively and rapidly removing Cs 137 was not a pragmatic solution under the requested criteria. An effective means of reducing dose rate was to remove the top 5 cm of soil and to bury it on-site under fresh or deeper excavated uncontaminated soil for shielding. A demonstration of this method was carried out by JAEA at a junior high school yard and kindergarten playground in the center of Fukushima-city. From this demonstration it was found that: 1. Distributions of radioactive nuclides and dose rate were almost uniform throughout the junior high school yard and kindergarten playground in Fukushima-city. 2. A storage method was found without moving the contaminated soil off-site until an agreement over the final method is accepted. 3. The dose rate at ground level was reduced from 3.1 µSv/h to 0.16 µSv/h by the removal of the top 5 cm of soil. The dose rate at 1 m above ground level was reduced from 2.5 µSv/h to 0.15 µSv/h. 4. The residual dose rate was considered to be dominated by radioactive nuclides from adjacent contaminated objects such as trees and buildings. 5. A spike in dose rate from the actual buried storage site could not be detected.\n",

K Sundaram 1  Karen A Bond 1  Aaron D Sozanski 1  Kevin M Fox 2  Jake W Amoroso 2  1Alfred University Alfred USA2Savannah River National Laboratory Aiken USAShow AbstractSulfate-containing wastes pose problems of limited solubility and retention in alkali borosilicate glasses. The past studies to optimize the composition of a glass frit for combination with the waste to improve sulfate retention while meeting other process and product performance constraints have resulted in a specific frit composition and a concentration limit for sulfate in the glass recommended for the next batch of sludge to be processed at Savannah River Site (SRS). Additionally, the sulfates can accumulate at the top of the melter, corroding the melt-contact materials. A maximum concentration of about 1.5 wt% has been reported in these glasses. We have studied sulfate solubility and retention in simulated borosilicate nuclear waste glasses. Our main objective is to increase waste loading of sulfur-containing wastes. We have selected the baseline borosilicate glass system and the simulated nuclear waste components developed by the Savanna River National Laboratory (SRNL) for our study. Current target sulfur level is 0.6 wt% at SRS, while our new target levels are 0.8 and 1.0 weight%. We have added sulfur in the form of sodium sulfate normalized into the glass network to our target levels. We have selected minor additives, barium, lead, and vanadium, to the predetermined glass matrix to increase the sulfate solubility. The solubility of these glasses will be determined initially by visual observation and then using the Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). We have also studied the sulfate volatilization of these glasses. We have used ICP-AES to determine the composition of the glasses. We have used well-established characterization tools (e.g.., UV-Vis-NIR, Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy) to study the glass structure. We have also used thermal analytical tools (differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to study the thermal stability of the glasses. Normalized solubilities and volatilization rates will be reported.\n",

Here we report on a series of reactive oxygen exchange nanolaminates between an oxygen source, CuO, and a reactive metal oxygen sink where the propensity for energy release is tailored by material selection and by multilayer geometry. These results suggest it is possible to create a class of energetic materials whose yield can be tailored for specific applications. In one set of experiments we demonstrate that by considering anion transport in the terminal oxide, we can produce multilayers that are unstable at room temperature, or those which require substantial thermal energy to ignite. We first explored this terminal phase hypothesis by comparing CuO-metal laminates with the reactive metals: Mg, Zr, and Al. The nanolaminates were exposed to rapid furnace anneals and subsequent x-ray diffraction to identify the onsets of oxygen exchange. Zr-CuO laminates were the least stable, owing to the fast oxygen transport through the ZrO2 terminal oxide, while CuO-Al laminates were the most stable, owing to the excellent diffusion barrier properties associated with Al2O3. CuO-Mg exhibited intermediate stability. A second demonstration is made for laminates of CuO and Al1-xTix where x is varied systematically between the pure end members. We identify a composition of ~ 35% Ti, above which the laminates react at RT, and below which temperatures of 300 C and above are require to initiate oxygen exchange. We will present sets of x-ray diffraction, SEM, and TEM data that illustrate the evolution of phase and microstructure in these “rapid” and “slow” oxygen exchange multilayer systems. In a second set of experiments we explore how geometry can be used to regulate the exothermic exchange reactions. For the reactive laminate systems of CuO-Al, CuO-Zr, and CuO-Mg, we prepared sets of multilayers of constant total thickness, but where the individual layer thicknesses are varied such that the number of metal oxide interfaces range from1 to 7. Using ex-situ x-ray diffraction and rapid furnace anneals, we identify that the minimum temperature needed to initiate the reaction drops in all cases on the order of 200°C as the number of interfaces increases. Calorimetry data for these samples show multiple exotherms that exhibit thickness-dependent temperatures. The exotherms can be attributed to the oxygen exchange from CuO and Cu2O to the reactive metal. The magnitude of the Cu2O exotherm and its temperature are strongly dependent upon the number of interfaces. Finally, we demonstrate that an applied voltage can be used to joule heat the electrically conductive laminate constituent and initiate the exothermic oxygen exchange. In all cases, small applied voltages could initiate the reaction. X-ray diffraction and optical images reveal that such reactions occur homogeneously over sample areas greater than 20 cm2.\n",

Rodriguez 2  Eric A. Stach 1  1Brookhaven National Laboratory Upton USA2Brookhaven National Laboratory Upton USAShow AbstractCeria-titania based powder catalysts have yielded noteworthy activity in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and the visible light driven photocatalytic splitting of water. The performance metrics of these mixed oxide materials are dependent on physical parameters such as particle size, morphology and electronic properties. Growth of ceria nanoparticles onto titania has been shown to provide unique structure and selectivity towards the aforementioned reactions considerably better than their individual counterparts. Studies of these catalysts using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) provides insight into the physical origins of the observed enhancement. The structure and oxidation state of ceria strongly depends on the processing conditions for synthesis. High-angle annular dark-field imaging reveals that the ceria takes on a plethora of morphologies and exists over different size-regimes ranging from atom clusters, atomically thin wires to nanoparticles. Because the ceria grows epitaxially on the titania this introduces strain and defects in the ceria as well as dictating the growth mechanics and hence the morphology. EELS measurements of the ceria-titania interface reveal the presence of intermixing while examination of the EELS fine structure identifies both Ce4+ and Ce3+ states can be present. These results elucidate the origins behind the improved performance and provide crucial insights on how to further tailor growth conditions for optimal structure and catalytic performance. The utilization of environmental transmission electron microscopy will subsequently provide insight into the catalytic reaction dynamics of this material system.\n",

Our scheme can be easily implemented into computer code to automatically find, explore and study large cavities which can accommodate the test-particle at low energy cost and whose contribution to the chemical potential thus dominates. This selective sampling helps reduce the computational cost by orders of magnitude, so that it is, for the first time (to our knowledge), practical to calculate chemical potentials of liquids entirely from first-principles, without the help of any high-quality empirical potentials as reference systems. This distinct advantage makes our method easily generalizable to a wide variety of materials, compared to the commonly used thermodynamic integration method (which depends heavily on the quality of reference potentials, in particular, their ability to stabilize the correct solid-state crystal structure). This is especially useful in automated materials screening effort in which melting point is a design parameter, since one does not need to develop empirical potentials for each of the chemical system explored. We benchmark our method using liquid copper, comparing our results to both experiments and other calculations.\n",

But a mere database of enthalpies provides only the starting point for uncovering the \"alloy genome.\" What one needs to fundamentally change alloy discovery and design are complete searches over candidate structures (not just hundreds of known experimental phases) and models that can be used to simulate both kinetics and thermodynamics. Despite more than a decade of effort by many groups, developing robust models for these simulations is still a human-time-intensive endeavor. We have developed an automatic framework for extracting cluster expansion-based models from a large database (www.aflowlib.org) of alloy enthalpies. Such a framework will uncover, in a general way across the periodic table, the important components of such models and reveal the underlying \"genome\" of alloy physics.\n",

A range of new HEMs and relevant additives have been synthesized and applied to civil and military research. The high power of those molecules can be attributed to the intriguing molecular structure and high nitrogen content. On the other hand, the highly sensitive nature of HEMs requires great caution when charging and handling. Researchers who design and synthesize new HEMs have pushed themselves to derive more powerful, yet safe HEMs. However, it is difficult to find promising HEM candidates because more powerful HEMs are generally sensitive, and vice versa. Owing to this inversely proportional tendency between performance and insensitivity, the search a promising novel HEM requires good strategies, not just a trial and error approach. It is important to understand the various molecular aspects and pinpoint the molecular aspects to enhance either the explosive performance or safety, for example, like the molecular design in drug discovery. So it is extremely important to select good candidate molecules in the early stages of development. One good way of identifying promising candidates is to have a good DB, which archives all previous information including the failures and possible virtual candidates, such as ICT thermochemical database which contains more than 12,000 compounds, although it only archives experimental values of known molecules. We developed the new on-line management system for HEMs, called MS-HEMs. It is designed to collect and store virtual HEMs as well as known HEMs to derive a new successful HEM, contrary to other previous HEM DBs including ICT thermochemical DB. With this feature, the on-line MS-HEMs can manage virtual HEMs designed by theoretical scientists as well as existing HEMs synthesized previously. Owing to the virtual molecules dealt with this DB, a large proportion of input records consist of molecular descriptors that can be obtained from quantum mechanical calculations. The user-friendly designed input screen and the search routine, where the users can find the exact HEM and its properties either by text/value or by 2D-chemical drawing, allow users easy to access or handle it. The DB has own built-in calculation routine, where a range of compositional and topological descriptors, heat of formation, and crystal density can be computed automatically when a new HEM is inputted into the MS-HEMs. In addition, the impact sensitivity can be calculated using in-house ANN codes. The on-line DB for HEMs is a potential molecule pool that combines real and virtual HEMs, and provides important knowledge in locating good HEM candidates with a sufficiently safe nature. This study was financially supported by ADD and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration(DAPA).\n",

Many applications require strong, tough, lightweight materials, and polymers or polymer composites are ideal candidates. Unfortunately, polymers are complex highly nonlinear materials, where desired properties often follow inverse trends with respect to each other with changes in composition or morphology (Murphy&’s Law for polymer science). Component design or analysis is facilitated by simulation techniques such as dynamic finite element analysis, FEA, at the continuum scale, which generally use empirical datasets for material properties in constitutive equations to allow calculation of local stress and temperature fields under dynamic loading. At the opposite end of the multi-scale spectrum, atomistic simulations such as molecular dynamics, MD, are computationally demanding and provide little insight into how to make structural changes for engineering materials design at the molecular level. The objective here is to simplify the detailed molecular modeling process to allow in situ integration into dynamic FEA codes by deriving a self-consistent set of analytical equations for bulk nonlinear mechanical properties directly from ensemble average potential energy wells for intermolecular interactions. The potential energy well for energy as a function of molecular dimensions requires only a limited number of single valued parameters (such as molar mass and volume, cohesive energy, and degree of crystallinity), which can be calculated directly from the chemical and morphological structure of the material using molecular techniques such as MD or quantum methods or empirical tools such as connectivity indices. Thus, FEA simulation can be performed by direct input of a chemical structure, or the parameter sets can be optimized within the FEA simulation framework to best satisfy sets of application design criteria. For example, elastic moduli predictions as a function of temperature and rate allows direct and rapid simulation of nonlinear stress-strain relations over all temperature, rate, and strain space, even with physically unrealistic values accessed by FEA codes during convergence. Thus, molecular or nanoscale simulations are coupled directly into the continuum codes by replacing empirical constitutive relations. A specific example of prime interest would be optimization of biomechanical compatibility of polymers for orthopedic implants, where we are reducing the model for potentially very complex protein structures and compositions (such as derived from silk products) to a tractable set of parameters (order, disorder and hydrated fractions) and routines that can be optimized in an interactive biomechanics FEA code.\n",

In this situation, the Inverse Design of Materials (for a given desired property, find the material that has it) can greatly accelerate the materials discovery and development. Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) are an example where the desired functionality requires counter-indicated materials properties, i.e., transparency and conductivity. While good n-type TCOs, such as In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO), are known and in commercial use, achieving p-type conductivity in transparent wide-gap oxides is much more difficult. We address this problem in the Inverse Design approach, which tightly couples theory and experiment, and integrates the three steps of (1) formulating design principles, (2) screening of a wider range of materials for multi-target properties, and (3) the final realization and validation of new materials by design. As a design principle, we proposed d5 oxides, which show a strong p-d coupling not unlike the prototypical Cu containing p-type TCO like, e.g., CuAlO2. Starting from a larger number of ternary Mn(II)-oxides (d5 high-spin) as candidate materials, including A2MnO4 (A=Ga, In, Cr) in the spinel structure, Mn2BO4 (B=Si, Ge, Sn) in both olivine and inverse spinel structures, and MnSnO3 in the ilmenite structure, We use ab-initio theory methods to down-select the candidate materials. The target properties include (i) thermodynamic stability under accessible growth conditions (ii) a sufficiently large band gap and absorption threshold, (iii) a sufficiently light effective hole mass (iv) the absence of hole-killer defects, (v) the absence of hole self-trapping (i.e., band- rather than small-polaron conductivity), and (vi) p-type doping by suitable impurities. Experimental synthesis and characterization of optical and electrical properties is performed for Cr2MnO4 and Mn2SnO4 in order to validate and realize the predicted materials. We identify Cr2MnO4 as a thermodynamically stable, wide-gap, and p-type dopable oxide with the characteristics of a band-conductor for holes (no carrier self-trapping). Since, however, Cr2MnO4 lacks a native intrinsic hole-producer (acceptor-type defect), we screen for suitable dopant impurities that would have sufficiently high solubility and shallow acceptor ionization energies, finding by theory that Li should be the best dopant. Bulk electrical measurements confirmed the expected insulating behavior of pure Cr2MnO4 and Mn2SnO4, and demonstrated a dramatic increase in the conductivity of Cr2MnO4 after Li-doping. This presentation highlights the individual steps in the Inverse Design approach that lead from a desired functionality to the realization of a best-of-class material.

Nanoporous Ti alloy specifically can be fabricated by a two-step dealloying method. Ti-Cr-Zr-Cu prealloy, (Ti0.847Zr0.056Cr0.098)20-Cu80, are soaked it into a Mg melt bath at 810 °C and only the Cu element is selectively dissolved into the bath. The remained Ti-Cr-Zr alloy self-organize into the sponge structure. A composite of Ti-Cr-Zr and Mg-Cu is then formed. The Mg-Cu phase is then removed from the composite in a nitric acid aqueous solution to form the nanoporous Ti-Cr-Zr. The size of the metallic ligaments and the pore size and therefore the mechanical properties of the foam can be tuned by changing the duration of the Mg bath soaking time. Therefore, the change in morphology due to the different duration of the soaking time is in the interest of study. We prepared the Ti-Cr-Zr-Cu prealloy samples which were soaked in Mg bath for 5, 10 or 30 min respectively, followed by the etching processed. Both the composite (Ti-Cr-Zr and Mg-Cu) and the end-product Ti alloy nanofoam were imaged in 3D using x-ray tomography techniques. With synchrotron source, micro-CT and high-resolution nano-tomography experiments were carried out to reveal the 3D morphology of the nanoporous titanium alloy at multiple length scales. The nano-tomography especially, was carried out at National Synchrotron Light Source where a newly equipped transmission x-ray microscope provides a unique markerless, automated tomography. This was an essential capability which enables local tomography and therefore a destructive sample preparation such as focus-ion-beam (FIB) milling can be avoided. We found that FIB milling would change the microstructure of the Ti nanofoam. The quantitative analysis of the 3D morphology of the nanoporous Ti alloy subjected to various soaking time, before and after etching will be presented.\n",

The imaging principle involves the magnification of the diffracted signal from individual (sub)grains by a compound refractive lens positioned between the sample and the 2D detector. Orientations and strain are mapped with a resolution of 0.001 deg and 10^-4, respectively. The spatial resolution is limited by the quality of available lenses, which currently is of the order of 200 nm. In comparison to existing techniques such as 3DXRD and DAXM spot overlap issue is less of an issue, and thicker specimens can therefore be studied.

The vast majority of publications covering manufacturing concepts employ a “roll-to-roll” process, in which a mechanically flexible substrate (plastic foil, metal foil, or paper) is guided through the individual manufacturing steps between an unwinding and a winding cylinder (“roll-to-roll”). As seen in the title of this MRS Symposium, the term “roll-to-roll” became a synonym for high-throughput production of organic electronics. The focus on web-fed processing in the scientific community remains ambiguous, as a variety of other forms of substrate transport is established in printing science and industry. The method of substrate transport is currently not considered in the move towards upscaling of printed electronics production. This paper introduces four different substrate transport technologies and reflects on their applicability to printed electronics. Besides the classical substrate technology concepts -- “roll-to-roll” and “sheet-to-sheet” -- we introduce two new technologies: “shuttle-transport” and the hybrid transport concept “roll-to-sheet”. Basic working principles, chances and limitations of each concept are discussed. In a further step, the perspective is broadened to the entire process from substrate-production until the assembly of the final product. We show that a second question is directly linked to the selection of a substrate transport technology: what is the optimal point for cutting the substrate web to individual sheets? This problem is more complicated than simply choosing between “roll-to-roll” or “sheet-to-sheet”. Therefore, a model for the cutting point of printed electronics manufacturing has been developed. We present one possible solution for the optimal point and offer an outlook on an expanded version, which incorporates parallelized sheet-fed printing machines.\n",

In this study, riblet patterns have been produced on large-area flexible polymer foils by roll-to-roll (r2r) UV-imprinting. These foils show a potential of up to 4-6 % viscous drag reduction and are easily applied on wind turbines, aircrafts or surf boards. The main challenge is the right choice of the substrate and the imprint resist. They have to show the combination of several major qualities, due to harsh outdoor conditions and a broad number of crucial r2r processing parameters. High flexibility, excellent weather- and UV-stability, scratch resistance have to come along with favorable r2r-processing parameters such as high curing speed and clean demolding from the Nickel imprint stamp. Therefore, polyethylene terephtalate (PET) foils have been selected and an UV-curable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) imprint resist has been developed. The coating of a 25 cm wide PET substrate web with the PUA-based imprint resist and the micro-structuring of the riblets has been performed on a custom made roll-to-roll coating and UV-imprint pilot machine. The riblet structures with dimensions of 10-80 microns have been created by interference lithography and then electroformed into a Nickel-roller-stamp (shim) having the size of ca. 27cm x 63 cm. This Nickel-shim is magnetically fixed onto the imprint cylinder and the UV-curing occurs from the backside through the substrate web. First successful r2r-imprints of exemplary riblet-type test patterns into UA-resist with high reproduction fidelity have been performed and shown to be homogeneous over more than 100m web length. UV-curable surface active molecules that are chemically bonded to the surface of the imprinted riblets provide durable water and dirt repellence to the drag reducing foils. Depending on the riblet orientation water contact angles of 100° and 145° are found on the r2r-imprinted riblet foils.\n",

Precise lateral alignment of the source and drain electrodes of the TFT with respect to its gate electrode are of particular relevance to the performance. On the way to roll-to-roll mass production we have developed a process that eliminates costly and time consuming alignment steps and is compatible with the use of flexible polymeric substrates. Our approach consists of four steps[1] starting with the application of a multi-material continuous stack onto a flexible polymeric substrate. Partially anodized aluminum is included to construct the gate electrode (aluminum) and gate dielectric (aluminum oxide) of the transistors while gold is added to provide the source and drain electrodes. Subsequently a layer of thermal imprint resist is applied and a multilevel pattern having the gate, source and drain structures intrinsically aligned, is applied in a single imprinting step. From this point on all structures conform coherently to any possible deformations of the substrate making sure that alignment is maintained throughout the process. One by one the patterned levels are removed and transposed into the underlying functional layers by series of selective etching steps. Finally the obtained structures are completed into functional devices by applying the semiconductor using ink jet printing. Transistors fabricated by this method show mobility values around 0.5 cm2V-1s-1 as can be expected using tips-pentacene as a semi-conductor. Taking the non-patterned continuous stack of materials as a point of departure allows us to use the aluminum gate layer as an electrode to grow anodized aluminum oxide as a gate dielectric material. Its dielectric properties combined with the low concentration of conductive defects that is inherent to the nature of the anodization process are major advantages contributing to the high yield ratios (220 out of 220 for 20µm structures) and the high on/off ratios (>106) that are obtained.

Solution-based deposition of ITO films is increasing significantly because this method is a low cost, simple, and atmospheric process compared to sputter deposition. Among the fabrication solution, two main types are used: metal-organic deposition (MOD) solutions and nanoparticle suspension. Nanoparticle ITO films have the advantages of controlling thickness and being pre-synthesized, however they showed much lower electrical conductivity (10-2 ~ 100 Omega;-1cm-1) than sputtered films (104 Omega;-1cm-1) as well as the MOD films (102 ~ 103 Omega;-1cm-1). In this research, highly conductive and transparent nanoparticle ITO films which are comparable to MOD and even sputtered ones are fabricated by applying new post treatment process; oxygen partial pressure annealing. Conductivity of ITO is determined by carrier concentration and mobility. Nanoparticle ITO has low mobility and carrier concentration due to high amount of organic impurity and lack of the oxygen vacancy. We design the effective annealing process improving conductivity and it is scientifically confirmed by carrier concentration and mobility change with variation of the annealing parameters. ITO nanoparticle ink had a solid loading of 20 wt % with an average particle diameter of 50 nm. The nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol. ITO nanoparticulate film was deposited on glass substrate by spin coater. After deposition, films were dried in oven and annealed in furnace with various temperature (250 ~ 550 °C), time (1 ~ 3 h), and ambient(Air, vacuum: 10-6 ~ 10-1 Torr). Microstructure, conductivity, and transmittance of ITO films were characterized. From microstructure analysis (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy), the fabricated samples were identified as highly crystalline nano-sized ITO particles films. Measured electrical conductivity of nanoparticle ITO was changed significantly by annealing temperature and ambient. Optimum conductivity (3 × 102 Omega;-1cm-1) can be obtained at 550 °C and the specific level of vacuum ambient (10-2 Torr). This result can be explained the relationship between annealing parameter and electrical properties, carrier concentration and mobility which can be separated by Hall measurement. And we can find why nanoparticle ITO had poor conductivity and how much these factors have to be improved. It is concluded that the burning of organic ligand and the change of oxygen vacancy concentration were the main factors for this conductivity change. Samples except in the case annealed in vacuum at high temperature, had the excellent the optical transmittance (T > 95 %, 300 nm thick). Maximum figure of merit is 5.4 × 10-3 Omega;-1 which is comparable to sputtered ITO thin films.\n",

Therefore devices enabling powerful analytical methods like electrochemical detection, spectroscopy, optical detection, and separation techniques along with cell piercing and fluid transfer capabilities at the intra-cellular level are desired. Glass pipettes have conventionally been used for single cell operations, however their poor material properties and an intrusive conical geometry have led to limited precision and scope of successful experimentation, and resulted in increased research efforts to develop novel, non-intrusive cell probes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known for their superior physical properties and tunable chemical structure and possess a high aspect ratio, minimally invasive tubular geometry. Moreover, significant accomplishments have been made by researchers on chemical functionalization of CNTs, making the idea of multi-functionality of resulting probe tips realistic. Here we report a novel fluidic device fabricated by isolating and assembling a “single” CNT at the tip of a glass pipette using a fluid flow based technique. The nanotube-glass junction was sealed with epoxy, to allow fluid flow from the glass pipette to the nanotube, thereby enabling continuous fluid handling capability into cells. The nanotube was functionalized with paramagnetic iron oxide and gold nanoparticles facilitating simultaneous remote magnetic manipulation of the tip and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Further, the glass pipette interior was coated with carbon facilitating electrophysiology. These probes were demonstrated to induce significantly less calcium response during cell piercing compared to glass pipettes. Thus, minimally intrusive \"multifunctional cellular endoscopes” were developed (reported in Nature Nanotechnology 6, 57-64 (2011)). Meanwhile, we demonstrated an individual CNT to function as a nano-separation column for separating attoliter volumes of mixtures of different analytes (smallest volumes ever analyzed!). In this regard we demonstrated separation of two fluorescent dyes of significantly different molecular weights by flow through a 200 nm amorphous nanotube stuffed with smaller 20-30 nm multiwalled CNTs as stationary phase (reported in Scientific Reports (2012)). Moreover we performed the process of liquid-liquid extraction using 200 nm amorphous CNTs by selectively extracting a fluorescent dye from a dye mixture using a solvent having different solubility for the two dyes. These nanotubes can then be used as aforementioned \"endoscope\" tips to perform separation processes on single cells.\n",

As a DNA molecule is forced in a nanochannel of height and width in the range of the DNA persistence length, the molecule stretches out. Single molecules can be isolated from the bulk and studied using high numerical aperture epifluorescence microscopy. This has been utilized to measure physical properties of DNA molecules such as their individual length. It has also recently been used to visualize sequence specific fluorescence barcodes obtained by labeling of nicking sites [1], the labeling of methylated sites [2], competitive staining [3] or partial melting [4]. Previous studies demonstrate barcoding for viral DNA or BACs in the length range of 50-200kbp, paving the way to applications within genomics. We have established a method for interfacing nanofluidic devices with samples such as a cell culture by extracting DNA from human metaphase chromosomes in lab-on-a-chip devices. This is implemented in two ways utilizing passive microfluidic trapping [5] or active optofluidic trapping [6] to select a single chromosome and extract the DNA by proteolysis. This method allows loading intact mega base pair long DNA strands onto a nanofluidic device. We will present our recent work toward visualizing mega base pair long DNA molecules and applying our method to genomics. References: [1] Das, S. K.; Austin, M. D.; Akana, M.

The vast majority of FET biosensors utilize well-established Si MOSFET technology. In contrast, emerging nano-electronic approaches hold promise for drastic improvement of sensor performance. These include the use of nanoscale patterning, high-κ gate oxides, high mobility channel materials, and 3D gate architectures. Our proof-of-concept sensor platform expands on this work using nanoscale finFET devices. There are several reasons for using finFET geometry over the standard planar FET geometry. In this architecture, the gate and channel regions protrude from the device, similar to the dorsal “fin” of a shark. The fin works to increase the amount of sensing surface area per volume of the semiconductor channel, which is strongly believed to enhance sensitivity. Our work predicts that, unlike planar devices, the charge of a single molecule in the fin (i.e., the gate) could affect the entire cross-section of the channel, causing strong current blocking effects. While ultra-sensitive finFETs have been fabricated and are being studied for nanoelectronics applications, they have not yet been applied to biomolecular sensing. Further, there has been limited work on in situ growth of alternative nanostructures (nanowires, nanotubes, etc.) for electrical biosensing and “top-down” fabrication using CMOS-compatible processes. In contrast, our approach uses manufacturing processes to construct nanoscale finFET devices with distinct advantages for production and dissemination. We have previously shown that DNA probes can be directly immobilized to hafnium oxide gate dielectrics for FET-based detection of DNA targets. Here we will present the results of finFET biosensor fabrication and initial testing of device sensitivity for DNA detection. Briefly, finFETs were fabricated on 300 mm wafers by etching 28nm fins into SOI wafers. A gate stack of HfO2, TiN, and amorphous-Si was deposited and the gate area defined lithographically. SiN self-aligned spacers were formed and selective N and P implants were performed to dope the source and drain of N and P devices, respectively. A layer of SiN and SiO2 was applied to protect devices from aqueous solutions during testing. With subsequent processing steps these layers, and the TiN layer, were removed to reveal the gate region of devices (for DNA sensing). A final lithography step opened the oxide over the source and drain contact pads. This provided points for electrical contact, as well as a non-metalized gate for direct DNA deposition and detection on the gate oxide. To our knowledge this is the first example of finFET biosensors being fabricated on a production-scale 300 mm wafer platform, and the first DNA biosensor using the finFET geometry.\n",

Siu 1   2  Jing  Feng 1  Alec  Roelke 1  G. Tayhas R.  Palmore 1   2   3  Domenico  Pacifici 1   2  1Brown University Providence USA2Brown University Providence USA3Brown University Providence USAShow AbstractPlasmonics is a rapidly emerging field of nanophotonics that focuses on the ability of noble metal nanostructures to manipulate light at the nanoscale. For example, by using nanocorrugations etched in a metal film, light at optical frequencies can be coupled to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are electromagnetic waves that propagate along a metal-dielectric interface. SPPs are confined at the metal surface and are very sensitive to small changes in the refractive index of the dielectric (e.g. aqueous solutions with biochemical analytes). We have recently reported on a compact, high-throughput plasmonic sensor based on surface plasmon interferometry optimized for real-time monitoring of glucose in aqueous solutions [1]. The sensor consists of a spatially dense, planar array of plasmonic interferometers (>1,000/mm2), where each interferometer is composed of 100nm-wide, 10µm-long grooves flanking a 200nm-wide slit etched in a 300nm-thick silver film using focused ion-beam milling. The distances between each groove and the slit were varied between 0.25 to 10µm in steps of 25nm. The detection limit of the plasmonic sensor for glucose in aqueous solutions is 5.5mu;M with a sensitivity of 105,000%/RIU (refractive index units) at 590nm. In order to improve the sensor selectivity to glucose, we propose a novel molecular recognition scheme that couples plasmonic interferometry with dye chemistry, specifically using 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red). In this implementation, glucose oxidase is added in solution to rapidly convert D-glucose into D-gluconolactone and H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The H2O2 reacts with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to oxidize Amplex Red into resorufin, a dye molecule which is characterized by a strong optical absorption coefficient at ~571nm. The reaction is monitored in real-time by simply measuring changes in the light intensity transmitted through the slit of each interferometer. As a result of the increased concentration of resorufin, the solution&’s refractive index and the absorption coefficient will increase, resulting in, respectively (1) a spectral shift in the interference conditions (Δlambda;), and (2) an intensity decrease due to increased SPP absorption (ΔΙ). These two changes, (Δlambda; and ΔΙ) will provide information on the change in refractive index which can be directly correlated to the glucose concentration. In this work, we will describe the use of plasmonic interferometers for monitoring the kinetics of Amplex Red, glucose oxidase and glucose reaction. The effects of absorption using an oxidative dye on the spectral response of the plasmonic interferometer will be discussed. This approach will lead to better sensor specificity and sensitivity and allow the use of plasmonic interferometry to develop point-of-care diagnostic tools for biomedical sensing of glucose and other clinically relevant analytes.

Here, utilizing a tunable photonic crystal (PC) resonant reflector as the wavelength selective element of an external cavity laser (ECL) cavity, we have demonstrated a novel single-mode continuous-wave narrow bandwidth emission and widely tunable external cavity laser biosensor, representing a fundamentally different approach to the problem of achieving high Q-factor resonance and simultaneously high-sensitivity for label-free resonant optical biosensors. The PC is fabricated inexpensively from plastic materials using nanoreplica molding, and its resonant wavelength is tuned by adsorption of biomolecules on its surface. Gain for the lasing process is provided by a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), resulting in a robust and simple detection instrument that operates by normally noncontact illumination of the PC and direct back-reflection into the amplifier. Through the process of stimulated emission, the laser biosensor generates its own resonant emission as narrow as 0.03 pm (lambda;0=850 nm; Δlambda;=0.03 pm), corresponding to a Q-factor (lambda;0/Δlambda;) of 2.8×107. By exposing the PC surfaces to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions at varying concentrations, sensor&’s bulk refractive sensitivity of 212 nm/refractive index unit is determined. The widely adopted metric for the intrinsic resolving power of resonator sensors is the figure of merit (FOM), defined as FOM = Sb×Q. Our obtained FOM is 5.9×109, representing the state-of-the-art resolving capability. We demonstrate single-mode, biomolecule-induced tuning of the continuous-wave laser wavelength with the ability to generate wavelength shifts as large as 13 nm, and the ability to discriminate wavelength shifts as small as <1 pm. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of such a system for the dynamic detection of an adsorbed monolayer of a protein polymer, the real-time detection of the incorporation of two distinct small molecules (biotin and estradiol) by immobilized large proteins (streptavidin and estradiol receptor), and finally, the selective detection of DNA using an immobilized capture-strand of DNA. Because this approach includes a mechanism for optical gain, the device represents a departure from previous optical biosensors using passive resonators. It enables simple optical coupling and a sensor format that is amenable to high-throughput multiplexed analysis for a broad array of applications in life science research, pharmaceutical screening, diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.\n",

Kirkland USAShow AbstractWhen operating at voltages low enough to avoid knock-on radiation damage, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEMs) allow volumes of matter as small as single atoms to be imaged and analyzed spectroscopically. The instrumental requirement for this type of work is that the STEM needs to be able to produce, at a low operating voltage, an electron probe not much bigger than 1 Å that contains a probe current of 0.1 nA and higher, and preferably has an energy spread of less than 0.4 eV. Such performance is now readily attainable. It has given us clear annular dark field (ADF) images of single atoms as light as boron, and it has identified the chemical type of single atoms in three different ways, sometimes simultaneously1: 1) by the atom&’s ADF intensity, 2) by its electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) and 3) by its energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDXS). The EELS data typically shows fine structures in spectra from the single atoms, and the structures are often substantially different than when the same kind of atom is bonded in other materials. The fine structures can be used to answer questions relating to charge transfer and atomic coordination numbers, atom-by-atom. Acquiring EELS and EDXS data simultaneously from single atoms also allows theoretical cross-sections to be tested with unprecedented accuracy. Experimental results from materials systems such as single atom impurities in and on graphene and monolayer BN will be shown, and likely future progress will be discussed. Our more recent quest to develop a low to medium kV electron beam analytical instrument that may ultimately be able to identify single atoms of hydrogen by their low energy vibrational spectra will also be described. The new instrument is designed to reach EELS energy resolution down to 10 meV with an atom-sized probe. It uses a monochromator of a new design2 that acts on full-energy electrons and thus minimizes stochastic Coulomb effects that typically limit monochromator performance, and at the same time allows the monochromator and the energy loss spectrometer to be linked together in such a way that both short- and long-term drifts of spectrum energy are largely avoided.

Pablo  Palafox-Hernandez 1  Tiffany R Walsh 1  1Institute for Frontier Materials, Deakin University Waurn Ponds AustraliaShow AbstractA large number of practical processes in nanotechnology involve the interactions of metals and peptides(1). However, the current understanding of the atomistic behavior of the aqueous peptide-metal interface is far from complete. In this work, we present atomistic simulations of the aqueous peptide-gold interface. The recently developed GolP-CHARMM force field(2) is employed to model the peptide-metal interactions due to its ability to capture the dynamic polarization of gold atoms, chemisorbing and the hybridized carbon-gold atoms. These features result in an accurate representation of the peptide binding in gold. Intensive Replica Exchange Solute Tempering(3) (REST) simulations were performed for a set of 12 different peptides(4). From the simulations, clustering analysis, contact motifs, Ramachandran plots, and the most probable conformations are obtained. These results expand the current understanding of the single residue binding and show the relevance of the contact residues and the role of entropy in peptide binding. The simulations reveal that the total binding strength is more than simply the sum of multiple anchoring residues, and that the position of the anchoring residues has a significant impact on the conformational entropy. These findings provide guidelines in the development of new peptide sequences that efficiently bind to gold interfaces.(1) Sarikaya, M.; Tamerler, C.; Jen, A.K.Y.; Schulten, K.; Baneyx, F., Nat.

Sotzing 4  Sanat  Kumar 3  Ramamurthy  Ramprasad 1  1University of Connecticut Storrs USA2Stony Brook University Stony Brook USA3Columbia University New York USA4University of Connecticut Storrs USAShow AbstractBeing a key component in modern electronics and electric power systems, the search for new high energy density dielectric materials has become a major scientific challenge. The current standard material for capacitive energy storage, polypropylene, has high electrical breakdown strength and low dielectric loss, but its dielectric constant is low.We are involved in a search for new classes of polymers with dielectric constant and band gap superior to polypropylene using first principles computations. Essential to this search are (i) strategies to efficiently navigate through the polymer chemical space (ii) schemes to identify promising building block motifs using our `high-throughput' first principles computations1, and (iii) identification of the stable crystal structures for these promising polymers. The present work involves aspect (iii). From our high-throughput first principles computations, it has been already determined that systems containing at least one aromatic group and at least one of the following moieties: -NH-, -CO-, or -O-, is desirable.1In order to predict the stable structure of these polymeric materials, we used a specifically designed constrained evolutionary algorithm2-4 consisting of well-defined molecular units or motifs that can successfully predict polymeric crystal structures from first principles quantum mechanical computations. The new constrained evolutionary algorithm based computational approach, which has been implemented in the USPEX code,2-4 is applied to a set of polymers for which reliable crystal structure information is already available experimentally, namely polyethylene (PE), polyacetylene (PA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO), poly(oxymethylene) (POM), poly (p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS), two forms of poly(vinyldene fluoride) (β -PVDF and δ -PVDF), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The excellent agreement between predicted and experimentally known crystal structures implies that this approach can play a crucial role in new polymer materials design. Next, we apply our methodology to predict the crystal structures for the identified new class of polymeric materials with high dielectric constant and high band gap. The dielectric properties computed for these new polymers in the optimized crystal structures indicate that the identified polymers are of sufficient technological importance, which are hence currently going through a synthesis cycle.

Incorporating comparable transport properties into a mechanically stable solid state device will not only eliminate expensive protein expression and separation steps, but can also provide a wide range of applications such as chemical delivery and sensing, energy generation, and water purification. The atomically smooth and inert structure of CNT walls allow for a nearly frictionless flow of molecules through the nanotube core over large lengths. For instance, water velocity in CNTs shows five orders of magnitude enhancement relative to other conventional materials of similar pore size, thus rivaling that of protein channels. In addition to fast flow rates, transport can be modulated by gatekeeper chemistry using steric hindrance, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, or biochemical state. The selectivity region can be precisely placed at the nanopore entrance by chemically functionalizing carboxylate groups formed at both ends from oxygen plasma cutting. In this study, by measuring the ionic current through individual single-walled CNTs spanning a barrier between two fluid reservoirs, we experimentally demonstrate the similarities between the highly selective and fast passage of ions through individual single-walled CNTs and protein ion channels. We also propose a theoretical model to explain the unique dependence of ionic conductance on electrolyte type and concentration in such systems. Fundamental understanding of nanofluidic systems is essential for elucidating the physical mechanism underlying significantly more complex biological nanochannels.\n",

Buehler 2  David L. Kaplan 1  1Tufts University Medford USA2Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge USA3Boston University Boston USA4Tufts University Medford USAShow AbstractGenetically engineered spider silk block copolymers are promising candidates to study the effect of block composition, sequence, and length on fiber formation. Spider silk block copolymers were prepared based on the assembly of two individual blocks, a hydrophobic poly-alanine rich block (A) and a hydrophilic glycine-rich block (B). The A block consisted of one polyalanine/polyglycine repeat (GAGAAAAAGGAG) responsible for β-sheet formation. The B block was composed of four GGX repeats, separated by the GSQGSGR sequence. Based on our previous work, we applied recombinant DNA technology to engineer the second generation of spider silk block copolymers H(AB)n and H(AB3)n to study the length effect on fiber formation. The constructs were cloned, expressed and purified and their secondary structures and morphologies were assessed by FTIR, SEM, and AFM. In terms of morphology, as the number of AB repeats increased, the transformation from disordered structures to nanofibrils occurred. For example, H(AB)12 block copolymer with Mw of 43.7kDa self-assembled into fibrils with an average diameter of 25 nm in aqueous media; whereas, H(AB)2 with an Mw of 11.6 kDa did not form particular morphologies. Moreover, fiber formation of H(AB)12 was induced by applying shear force in protein solution using an AFM tip. In addition the effect of solvent environment on structure formation was studied. We used water and 2-propanol to assess the solvent effect on structure formation. In the case of H(AB) 3 when 90% 2-propanol was used as a solvent, smooth round nanospheres were observed with an average diameter of 100 nm. Elongated microparticles were observed when water was used as a solvent for H(AB)3. This approach demonstrates successful implementation of our previously developed silk block copolymer strategy to regulate material features by manipulation of the block domains in spider silk-like copolymers.\n",

However, so far there have been the following issues that in order to increase the piezoelectric property of piezoelectric-rubber, a large amount of the large size piezoelectric-ceramic particles must be mixed in the rubber, resulting in loss of the elastic property of the piezoelectric-rubber.In the previous investigation, it was confirmed that the orientation of the piezoelectric-ceramic particles in the direction normal to the surface of the rubber was effective in increasing d33 which indicates the piezoelectric coefficient when the input load is applied and the output electric charge is taken both in the direction of thickness of rubber. On the other hand, it is considered that the piezoelectric property of the “Oriented-Type” in which the piezoelectric-ceramic particles is oriented in the rubber is strongly affected by rubber&’s property as the matrix of the Oriented-type, because the volume of the rubber of Oriented-type is larger than that of the PZT particles and the stress on the oriented particles is affected by the property of matrix.Therefore the influence of the matrix property on piezoelectric property of Oriented-Type was investigated. In the investigation, the Young&’s modulus of matrix was focused as the matrix property. The lower the Young&’s modulus of matrix is, the higher d33 of Oriented-Type is, because the stress applied to oriented PZT particles in Oriented-type increases. Four kinds of matrix materials were investigated: Silicone gel, Silicone rubber, Urethane rubber and Poly-methyl-methacrylate. The Young&’s modulus of matrix materials are as follows: Silicone gel is 5MPa; Silicone rubber, 70 MPa; Urethane rubber, 180MPa; and Poly-methyl-methacrylate, 600MPa. The piezoelectric-ceramic particles to be mixed with the matrix materials are the same particles of Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT).As the result of investigation, the sample made of the silicone gel which had the lowest Yang&’s modulus in the selected matrix materials had the largest d33. The large increase as compared with the previous investigation was observed. The d33 of the fabricated sample was more than 60 pC/N when the concentration of PZT particle was about 10 Vol%. The Oriented-type using silicone gel as matrix is expected to be the vibration-isolating materials having the property of sensor, because the volume of silicone gel is 90 Vol% and Young&’s modulus is 12MPa even if the sample is the piezoelectric-rubber of Oriented-Type.\n",

Schubert 1   2  Matthias  Hartlieb 1   2  Christine  Weber 1   2  Michael  Gottschaldt 1   2  1Friedrich Schiller University Jena Jena Germany2Friedrich Schiller University Jena Jena GermanyShow AbstractPoly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) are an interesting, yet less well-known class of polymers although they are thermo-responsive [1], non-toxic and possess similar stealth properties as PEG [2]. Thus, they represent highly promising materials for the development of intelligent drug delivery devices in various kinds of compositions, such as linear, block or comb-like macromolecules, and hydrogels. Thereby, the living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) mechanism allows a straightforward design of the polymer properties by copolymerization as well as the attachment of cell targeting ligands or labels. A range of thermo-responsive comb and graft copolymers are accessible by end-capping the living oxazolinium species from the CROP of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx) and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of the obtained macromonomers. On the one hand, this allows insights into the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of polymers that exist as macromolecular bottle brushes in aqueous solution [3]. On the other hand, the LCST properties can be brought into the physiological range by copolymerization with methacrylate-based monomers, such as methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid [4,5]. Due to the introduced carboxylic acid moieties, the latter graft polymers are responsive not only to temperature but in to the pH value as well. In addition, the advanced polymeric architectures have been functionalized with cell-targeting sugars selectively at the end of the side chains [6]. Another way to introduce thermo-responsiveness into POx is the variation of the side group of linear polymers by the co-polymerization of functional 2-oxazolines. The introduction of primary amine groups using a statistical co-polymerization results in a system whose LCST depends on the pH value. The gelation of these phase separated polymer solutions by cross-linking of the amine moieties leads to hydrogels with a distinct microstructure. The resulting cationic networks can be used to selectively bind and release genetic material for the purpose of purification or detection in microarrays and DNA chips.[7]1. C. Weber, R.

Using a silane self-assembling monolayer (SAM)-based procedure pioneered by V Hlady, et al. we have developed an assay capable of covalently binding a wide variety of proteins to an optically transparent surface in a 2D pattern via amine linkages. This new assay provides greater control of protein concentration and gradient intensity than possible in assays using solubilized proteins.To achieve a smooth and continuous gradient, a monolayer of beta-mercatopropyltrimethoxysilane was deposited unto a quartz substrate in an ultra-high purity Nitrogen-filled glovebox (>1.9 mm Hg) under anoxic anhydrous conditions. The silane polymerization reaction was performed by immersing an acid etched quartz slide in 99.9% anhydrous toluene and catalyzed with the addition of 5 uL of water to 100 mL of toluene. Polar/non-polar emulsion was achieved by addition of .51 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate /mL water and sonication. Chemical gradients were formed by selectively inducing the oxidation of surface thiol groups present in the silane monolayer via UV irradiation in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, using a mask and translating stage. This process results in conversion from thiol to sulfonate groups. Protein bonding is achieved through the use of a heterobifunctional crosslinker (SMPEG12) that contains maleamide and NHS groups capable of binding selectively to thiol and amine groups respectively.Results from preliminary investigations into the silane monolayer chemistry using contact angle goniometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate that a monolayer of silane is formed, and for specific irradiation times, there is a linear relationship between the total irradiance and conversion from thiol to sulfonate groups. Specific protein and crosslinker concentration in units of ng/um2 will be verified by XPS. Initial cell microscopy studies planned include time lapse phase contrast and fixed focal contact immunostaining (vinculin, actin, etc.) of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells.\n",

Soluble type I collagen (Col) which gels at 37°C can be cross-linked with genipin (Gen), a plant extract. Hyaluronic acid (HA)-tyramine (Tyr) and gelatin (Gtn)-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (HPA) conjugates enable independent control of the rate and degree of cross-linking through the addition of peroxidase and H2O2, respectively, using concentrations below the cytotoxic threshold. Secondary growth factor release vehicles, polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PCNs) and lipid microtubules (LMT), can be incorporated into the gels for the controlled delivery of chemoattracting growth factors. In vitro, Col-Gen and Gtn-HPA gels have been found to be permissive of cell adhesion and migration of astrocytes and neural stem cells, respectively, under the influence of PCNs releasing SDF-1α and LMTs releasing FGF-2, for potential applications in treating defects resulting from spinal cord injury and stroke. In other studies, Gtn-HPA has been seeded with retinal pigment epithelial cells for the treatment of retinal disease, and HA-Tyr has been employed for cartilage tissue engineering. In vivo, Col-Gen/LMT-FGF-2 gels have been evaluated in a hemi-resection rat model, and Gtn-HPA/PCN-SDF-1α has been injected into a rat stroke model, with promising results. These injectable ECM-based gels may ultimately serve alone as scaffolds to facilitate endogenous cell migration into the gel (PCN/LMT)-filled defect or as carriers for exogenous cells in regenerative medicine applications. Additionally the gels can be used in vitro to provide favorable microenvironments for tissue engineering.\n",

Viruses have, for instance been used as biological templates, delivery vessels, and nanoscale catalysts for chemical reactions or materials synthesis. In this work we use of a virus-like particle as a multivalent platform to demonstrate vitro targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) experiments toward breast cancer. PDT is an effective treatment for many cancer types, yet the current class of photosensitizers suffers from lack of tissue specificity, often leading to unwanted side effects. By loading photosensitizers into a targeted nanodelivery vessel, potential side effects resulting from systemic photosensitizer accumulation could be avoided. Additionally, delivering a relatively high concentration of photosensitizers in a confined nanoscale volume can increase the amount of localized singlet oxygen concentration, leading to increased PDT efficacy. In this work, nanoscale drug delivery vessels are formed via nucleotide-driven packaging of cationic porphyrins inside MS2 bacteriophage capsids, followed by attachment of G-quadruplex DNA aptamers to the capsid exterior via chemical conjugation. Prior work has demonstrated that approximately 250 porphyrins can be loaded into each capsid, and capsid-loaded porphyrins retain their capability to generate singlet oxygen upon photoexcitation with 632 nm light. The G-quadruplex DNA aptamer targets nucleolin, which is often overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells. We show that approximately 80 DNA aptamers were conjugated to the surface of each capsid, previously loaded with the cationic porphyrin TMAP. Cell viability was assayed with the MTT assay and Live/Dead staining where targeted PDT experiments showed that MCF-7 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells were selectively killed, whereas normal human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells remain unaffected.\n",

Such control can be difficult to achieve using traditional formulations, given that individual drugs often exhibit widely varying molecular weight, charge, and lipophilicity, arriving at the tumor site at differing times and partitioning over vastly different areas. Although the delivery of multiple, distinct nanoscale drug carriers can improve tissue disposition and kinetics, vehicle-associated toxicity is compounded, limiting the safety and therapeutic index of these strategies. Self-assembled layer-by-layer (LbL) nanoparticles provide a means with which to safely and effectively deliver a range of multicomponent therapeutics to solid tumors. Recent work in the Hammond Lab has focused on the development of nanoscale LbL architectures that are both pH-responsive and active tumor-targeting. Here, we found that polyamine/glycosaminoglycan LbL architectures can achieve both low non-specific uptake and hypoxia-induced cellular delivery. These drug carriers selectively bound cell-surface CD44 receptor, a well-characterized marker for breast carcinoma cells with stem-like, mesenchymal, tumor-initiating, hypoxia-inducible, and drug-resistant phenotype. These LbL nanoparticles diminished triple-negative breast cancer cell migration and invasion, in vitro, in a receptor-selective manner. In vivo, these particles co-localized with CD44 receptor in murine tumor xenograft models, displayed ca. two-fold lower liver accumulation versus comparable anionic polysaccharide-terminal architectures, and elicited low and transient changes in plasma cytokine levels following intravenous administration. Layer-by-Layer polymer nanotechnologies provide a robust, modular, and scalable platform for multicomponent drug delivery to solid tumors.\n",

The ability to multiplex different functionalities in the same particle is of paramount importance in multi-modal imaging and guided surgery1. The controllable incorporation of multiple active agents within a single particle remains to date a major challenge. In typical top-down approaches, the polymer is impregnated with the active agents, which limits the combinations of functionalities accessible. Bottom-up approaches, on the other hand, are complicated by the necessity of synthesizing multifunctional particles in a sequential manner. Here we address this challenge by developing a general methodology for controlling the geometric distribution of multiple functionalities within the three-dimensional volume of a polymeric micro- or nanoparticle. We make use of a recent strategy we have developed2-4 for the scalable production of size-tunable particles based on fluid instabilities induced thermally at the heterogeneous interfaces within a multimaterial fiber. We first construct a macroscopic ‘preform&’ consisting of a cylindrical core made of the particle material of choice surrounded by a cylindrical polymer cladding matrix. The preform is heated and drawn into an extended fiber with reduced transverse scale. The drawn fiber is then thermally treated to induce the Plateau-Rayleigh capillary instability (PRI), which leads to the transformation of the intact core into a necklace of spherical particles held in isolation from each other, which are then harvested by selective dissolution of the sacrificial cladding. Our approach here to produce multifunctional particles is to strategically design the preform by doping different axial segments of the core with active materials of choice that endow it with the desired functionality. Specifically, we identify a wide range of functionalities compatible with this process, including optical (fluorescence from organic dyes or quantum dots), magnetic, or Raman functionalities incorporated into particles derived from a wide range of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. Next we demonstrate that each one of these functionalities may be confined geometrically within any desired radial or azimuthal segment of the particle. Finally, we combine these two capabilities by fabricating particles with up to four distinct functionalities controllably distributed within the particle volume.Our in-fiber approach paves the way to three-dimensional digital design of multi-functional polymeric particles for nano-medicine, where the desired functionalities and their geometric placement within the particle are controlled by simply changing the structure of a macroscopic preform from which the fiber is drawn.

In previous studies, it was necessary to immobilize enzymes on the printing tip to prevent the loss of image quality resulting from enzyme mobility along the surface2. Since the enzyme must be held in contact with the polymer surface to catalyze its degradation, long incubation times were required in these studies to image films only a few nanometers thick. The goal of our study is to develop a printing process where the enzyme need not be immobilized on the printing tips, but transferred completely to the surface, while maintaining good image quality.The enzyme, Candida antartica lipase B (CALB), is known to catalyze the decomposition of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) films in humid environments at 37oC. A Polymer Pen Lithography3 (PPL) technique was used to deposit an aqueous solution of CALB onto a spin-cast PCL film. The PPL printer used in this study employs an array (typically 10 x 10) of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) printing tips mounted to a multi-axis robot such that multiple patterns, one from each tip, are created in parallel. By programming the printing sequence, any arbitrary pattern of enzyme ink deposits can be generated, one pattern for each tip in the array. The tips are coated with enzyme solution before each printing cycle by dipping into an inkwell. The PDMS tips are then brought into contact with the PCL surface using a controlled force and time to transfer the enzyme. After printing, the film was incubated at 37oC and 87% RH. CALB selectively catalyzes the degradation of the PCL film during incubation, forming etched features through the film thickness with straight sidewalls and no lateral spreading. Interactions between the enzyme and the PCL film restricts lateral diffusion of the enzyme and improves resolution compared to previous printing methods. These etched micro-wells may be used as containers in functional material synthesis, tissue engineering, drug discovery and drug testing. The design of the printer and the effect of printing parameters and incubation conditions on lithographic resolution will be presented. In addition the effect of PCL spherulite size will be discussed. REFERENCES:1. Hyun, J.; Kim, J.; Craig, S.L.; Chilkoti, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 4770-4771. 2.

Metasurfaces composed of (complex) patterns of individual optical scatterers are key to achieving this function. Here, we present metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric nanoparticles that support (Mie-like) geometrical resonances in the visible spectral range. Unlike plasmon resonances, these geometrical resonances are driven by displacement currents rather than actual current flows. The resonances therefore have low absorption losses and correspondingly high quality factors that are purely determined by radiative loss. Dielectric Mie scattering is described by both electric and magnetic multipole resonances, the latter driven by displacement current loops. Due to the different scattering patterns of electric and magnetic resonances and the ability to tune their spectral overlap, the light scattering from engineered dielectric metasurfaces can be controlled in a unique way.Here, we use optical experiments and numerical simulations to study the electric and magnetic resonances of silicon nanoparticles that are coupled to a planar substrate. While Mie scattering from isolated nanoparticles is well-understood, the strong coupling to the substrate in metasurfaces results in very complex modal interplay of the scattering and incoupling of light. We investigate the influence of particle shape, particle dimensions (d = 75-250 nm, h = 50-250 nm), substrate index, particle index, excitation mechanism (in-plane and out-of-plane polarization) and presence of low index spacer layers on the particle eigenmodes. We show that careful engineering of the geometry and photonic environment gives accurate control over the spectral position (lambda; = 400-800 nm), resonance width and angular radiation pattern, and allows the selective enhancement or suppression of the magnetic or electric eigenmodes. We find that the excitation of the displacement current loops is determined by retardation of the incident light across the particle and can thus be controlled by the thickness.Next, we investigate metasurfaces composed of coupled Mie resonators and find that near-field coupling of resonant Mie scatterers leads to strong mode splitting. We use electron-beam lithography to fabricate arrays of coupled Mie scatterers with a controlled spacing in the range 0-100 nm. By controlling the coupling, the angular radiation patterns can be precisely controlled.We use substrate-conformal soft-imprint lithography in combination with reactive ion etching and thermal evaporation to fabricate metasurfaces over a full 4” silicon wafer. Scattering nanoparticles are composed of either TiO2 or Si. Optical scattering and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy are used to identify the electric and magnetic modes, which are identified by their distinct angular radiation profiles.\n",

Donnelly 1  Kokou B. Dossou 2  Lindsay C. Botten 2  Ara A. Asatryan 2  Christopher G. Poulton 2  Ross C. McPhedran 1  C. Martijn  de Sterke 1  1The University of Sydney Sydney Australia2University of Technology Sydney Sydney AustraliaShow AbstractThe efficiency of thin film solar cells can be enhanced by nanoscale structuring the absorber, notably in the form of periodic Nanowire (NW) & Nanohole (NH) arrays. Even though both are 2D nanophotonic diffraction gratings and are each other&’s complements, the isolated inclusions of high refractive index NWs have their own modes which makes them strikingly distinct from the connected high index background in NH arrays. This produces strong differences in the absorption properties of NW & NH arrays.Electromagnetic simulations of NW and NH arrays are numerically involved as they require accurate solutions to Maxwell's equations. Calculating the absorption across the solar emission spectrum is therefore computationally expensive.Here we apply fundamental physical arguments and semi-analytic calculations to find optimal design parameters for both NW and NH arrays in seconds; this would otherwise require intensive simulations of a large parameter space. Our approach also provides insights that ensure that a global maximum of photovoltaic efficiency is found which only depends on the complex refractive index of the materials used. As an established test case we apply our method to Silicon (Si) NW and NH arrays on a silica substrate with an air superstrate.Since the bandwidth of the nanostructure is limited we first select the wavelength range for which the absorption is to be maximised so as to optimise the ultimate efficiency. Wavelengths less than 450 nm are below the peak of the solar photon flux, and are already strongly absorbed due to the large Im(n) of silicon. For wavelengths over 900 nm, Im(n) of silicon and the solar flux are both low and we therefore focus on maximising the absorption in the 450-900 nm range.It is key in our approach to minimise the number of loss channels in reflection and transmission, whilst maximising the number of highly absorptive modes in the absorber. For NWs the dominant loss mechanism is transmission which is limited by restricting the period, d<620 nm, such that no more than two propagating diffraction orders exist in the substrate. The strongly absorbing modes in NW arrays, Key Modes (KMs), can be accurately described by a dipole model [Sturmberg et. al. 2011]. Here we use this model to calculate the number of KMs that exist across the solar peak wavelengths. To maximise this number, the NW radii (r) should be as large as possible. Although reflection tends to be low for SiNW arrays, the Fresnel reflection grows as the silicon fill fraction (ff) increases, which limits the ff. By applying these constraints on the interrelated parameters of d, r, ff, we find a small region of parameter space where all conditions are simultaneously met. The procedure for NH arrays is similar, except that the reflected, rather than the transmitted diffraction orders are important. The optimal parameters found for NWs and NHs are in excellent agreement with full numerical calculations & with results from the literature.\n",

For maximum light-matter coupling strength between a target QD and the optical mode of the microcavity, both spatial and spectral mode matching need to be controlled precisely. To achieve spatial alignment, site-controlled growth of QDs has received great attention. However, the resulting QDs still suffer from a reduced optical quality as compared to self-organized QDs (e.g. via the Stranski-Krastanow growth mode). Moreover, for a fully deterministic device technology it will be vital to ensure also spectral alignment which has been achieved up till now only by optical in-situ lithography.In this work, we report on a novel, fully-deterministic nanophotonic device technology using high-resolution in-situ electron-beam lithography. Our approach combines low-temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy with electron-beam lithography and is demonstrated on samples containing self-organized QDs in the active layer. The lithography process starts by spin-coating the sample with the standard electron-beam resist PMMA.Then we map the local origin of the QD luminescence by CL at low electron-beam dose to avoid an over-exposure of the resist. The luminescence map allows us to select and determine the position of single QDs with suitable spectral features. Next, we write nano-structures into the resist aligned to the selected the chosen QDs. For writing structures, a higher electron dose is applied locally to invert the resist. This way the exposured PMMA acts as an etch mask with feature sizes of standard high-resolution electron-beam lithography.To demonstrate this approach, a sample with a low density of self-organized QDs is mapped and sub-µm mesa structures are spatially aligned to single QDs. After etching the sample, another CL-mapping is applied to verify the positioning process. It nicely demonstrates that all mesa-structures are at the pre-selected positions and 90% of them show luminescence from the chosen QDs. To further investigate the optical properties we performed micro-photoluminescence measurements at low temperatures. We observe resolution-limited emission linewidths of 9 µeV, proofing the good optical quality of our nanophotonic structures. Single-photon emission is verified by second-order correlation measurements on single emission lines, resulting in g(2)(0) = 0.04 [1]. Our deterministic lithography technique combines the pre-selection of quantum emitters by means of their lateral and spectral positions with the ability of patterning low-dimensional structures with nm-precision and thus will pave the way for a new generation of fully deterministic quantum devices with unprecedented complexity and quality.[1] M.

Among the strategies to improve the solar cell efficiency, periodic photonic nanostructures can be utilized to increase the light harvesting capability. For instance, photonic elements such as 1-dimmentional Bragg stacks and 3-dimensional inverse opal structures are introduced into photoelectrode to absorb the non-absorbed photons by light active materials. We introduce soft-template-derived photonic bandgap films into conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to improve the light harvesting of dye molecules. Periodic organic-inorganic multilayer films are constructed by stepwise buildup of block copolymer (BCP) inverse micelles. The multilayered BCP films exhibit strong reflective color and well-defined photonic stop bands. The layered films are integrated into the non-conducting side of counter electrodes and thereby remarkably enhanced overall power conversion efficiency is achieved, which can be attributed to the increased light harvesting by sensitized dye molecules.Another promising method to improve the light trapping effect can be coupling of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects, which will lead to further enhancement of the photocurrent. Localized SPR (LSPR) phenomenon is induced by excitation of hot-electrons that can lead to the optical field enhancement at the resonance wavelength. In this work, plasmonic DSSCs containing two types of Au-TiO2 core-shell nanostructures with mutually antagonistic configuration are demonstrated. Enhancement in cell efficiency can be attributed to not only the increase of the dye excitation by LSPR effects associated with near-filed enhancement and scattering but also generation of additional photocurrent induced by direct hot-electron transfer from plasmonic core-shell structures to TiO2 conduction bands. Next, we show that plasmonic coupling phenomenon can be a versatile platform to enhance the sensitivity of SPR-based biosensing. Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with dipicolylamine and bisindole moieties are utilized as highly selective sensors for metal anions/cations and thiol-containing proteins. We designed a plasmonic-coupling-based sensing device consisting of AuNPs separated from the Au substrate in SPR spectrometer through a stimuli-responsive polymer linker layer. We also demonstrate that bimetallic nanostructures containing another type of metal NP at the stimuli-responsive polymer periphery exhibit a controlled optical sensing property based on LSPR coupling phenomenon. The simple yet novel approaches presented in this work can be utilized as generalized protocols and applied to increase the function of various photonic and optoelectronic devices.\n",

A promising method for achieving enhanced light trapping is the incorporation of 3-dimensional metallo-dielectric photonic crystals into PV devices. We herein present the fabrication methodology and characterization of 3D silver hollow nano-lattices whose hierarchical dimensions span from tens of nanometers in individual strut diameter, to several microns in unit cell size, to hundreds of microns in overall structure extent. The tailored design of hollow Ag nanolattices allows these structures to not only act as 3D waveguides which direct optical mode propagation, but also as surface plasmon coupling structures. Enhancement in light trapping is thus achieved by creating interference between different modes propagating throughout the periodic array, as well as through the excitation of surface plasmon resonances in the metal-dielectric interfaces through absorption of frequencies in the solar spectrum. The novel 3D plasmonic waveguides, or nanotruss lattices, were fabricated utilizing state of the art two photon lithography, followed by plasma sputtering of the plasmonic material, resulting in conformally coated complex silver nanostructures. The core polymer within the nanotruss structures was then selectively etched out, resulting in the creation of silver-air metallo-dielectric photonic crystals.\n",

However there is great interest in understanding the properties of graphene plasmons across the infrared spectrum, especially at energies exceeding the graphene optical phonon energy. We have used infrared microscopy to observe the modes of tunable plasmonic graphene nanoresonator arrays as small as 15 nm. We map the wavevector-dependent dispersion relations for graphene plasmons at mid-infrared energies from measurements of resonant frequency changes with nanoresonator width. By tuning resonator width and charge density, we probe graphene plasmons with lambda;p le; lambda;omicron; /100 and plasmon resonances as high as 310 meV (2500 cm^-1) for 15 nm nanoresonators. In this talk, we also demonstrate how the plasmonic absorption of a graphene sheet is enhanced and perturbed in controllable ways by controlling the thickness and permittivity of the supporting substrate. We will show the results of recent experiments where 20% absorption is achieved in the plasmonic modes of a graphene sheet by carefully selecting the properties of underlying boron nitride and silicon nitride substrates. We also demonstrate how additional absorption pathways can be created by modifying the surrounding dielectric environment to have optical resonances that can couple to the graphene plasmons. These new composite resonances are a versatile tool in expanding the working range of graphene plasmonic devices, as well as exploring the fundamental physics of plasmons in two-dimensional materials. A theoretical model that explains our results has been developed and is used to predict the performance of optically active graphene structures.\n",

The hybrid photonic crystal structure uses the effect of surface morphology on the optical properties to introduce the selectivity in frequencies for the emission. The thermal emission in a certain set of frequencies can be suppressed while allowing the crystal to emit radiation limited in a narrow band of frequencies. The emission spectrum tunability has been confirmed by using experimental setup as well as theoretical calculations. A metal-dielectric composite with the top metal surface etched into sub wavelength nanostructures is made the base case for the emitter design. From thereon, various periodic arrays of rectangular or circular holes as well as gratings were introduced in the base case [2-3]. While simulating the emission spectrum different metals including Silver, Gold, Tungsten, Nickel and Platinum were considered. Also, changing the dielectrics with varying indexes was also seen to impact the shape of the emission spectrum. Effect of etch depth in such periodic structures was also taken into account. Variations in period of the array and the dimensions of each hole were also noted to affect the narrowness of spectrum. Such frequency selectivity can be attributed to phenomena including Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) coupling as well as diffraction by the grating structure [4].References:1. M. U. Pralle, N.

Environmental limit for the mass concentration of PM2.5 has been strictly established at less than 15 mu;g/m3 as an annual average with less than 35 mu;g/m3 as a daily average, and that of SPM has been established at less than 0.10 mg/m3 as a daily average with less than 0.20 mg/m3 as an hourly average. A rapid analytical technique with a wide detection range for PM is required.In the 1960s, metal mesh devices (MMDs) with two-dimensional periodic structures were found to exhibit frequency selectivity, and could be used as band-pass filters. The frequency selectivity depends on the size characteristics of the MMDs. The electric field is localized around the surface of the MMD, and as a result a dipped structure is observed in the transmittance infrared (IR) spectrum of the MMD. Intrusion of matter into the electric field localized on the surface of the MMD leads to a shift in the dipped frequency. Therefore, MMDs is applied as a sensor. In this study, the detection of PM in air was performed using MMD sensing, where the MMDs functioned both as a membrane filter for the collection of PM and as a band-pass filter for the detection of PM. A 100 THz-operated MMD with a 2.6 mu;m grid interval and a 1.8 mu;m opening length was used for the collection and detection of SPM. After the recovery of air through the MMD, the collection of SPM on the MMD was observed by optical microscope. Changes in dipped frequency in the transmittance spectra of the MMD containing SPM were found to have a linear relationship to the mass concentration of SPM, which was determined by the Ministry of the Environment in Japan, with a high coefficient of determination. The MMD sensor enabled the collection and detection of PM.\n",

Accurate alignment of the passivation layer solely on top of the grid line is crucial in order to minimize loss of aperture ratio in the active device. To minimize overhang of the passivation layer from line edges, we have studied a self-alignment method for solution-processable, cross-linkable polymer insulator films. The method is based on Joule heating: electrical current heats the metal lines, causing a localized temperature increase at the vicinity of the conductor, which locally cures the insulator [1]. After curing it is possible to remove the uncured polymer. The degree of localization depends on the temperature selectivity of the cured polymer and the thermal conductivity of the substrate. The spreading of the heat into the substrate increases the overhang of the passivation layer.In this work, finite element simulations were performed to investigate the heating of the sample using either glass or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate. The sample was at the room temperature and the current was selected to induce a temperature of 400 K at the conductor. The selection of substrate material is crucial for the localization of cross-linking. For the PET substrate, the temperature gradient at the edge of the conductor is approximately two times the gradient for glass. As a result, using a glass substrate demands high selectivity from the polymer cross-linking, thus making PET more suitable substrate material for our application.[1] M. Janka, S. Tuukkanen, T.

In our work, we fabricated an inverted organic photo diode with tandem structure having high a quantum efficiency and low dark current without loss of the incident light. The tandem structure was formed as interfacial layer which connected layer with two cells which absorbed each the same wave length of illumination. The interfacial layer is important to prevent a recombination which electron from top cell and hole from bottom cell is encountered. In our experiment, Carriers from top cell and bottom cell is capable to move to electrodes efficiently without recombination by using high doping interfacial layer such as high doped C60 in dicyanovinyl-terthiophene. The tandem organic photo diode shows to get as high as 25% of external quantum efficiency at 3V, 47% at 10V. And dark current of organic diode has very low cost at 5.5E-9A/cm2 at 3V. The C60 doping degree of Interfacial layer and thickness of Interfacial layer affect EQE and Dark current characteristics. We believe that an organic photodiode such as tandem structure would be promising as a next-generation high resolution image sensor.\n",

In particular, lead chalcogenide (PbX, X = S, Se, Te) NCs are prospective for photovoltaic applications where high power conversion efficiency has been demonstrated [1-2]. By changing the size of the NCs, the bandgap can be varied and the absorption edge can be tuned. Among the other unique properties of these NCs are the possibility to have multiple exciton generation (MEG), utilizing the discrete higher energy sub-bands formed by the quantum confinement of CNCs [3]. Therefore, a complete understanding of the energy levels of CNCs is necessary, not only the size dependent bandgap but also the complete picture of the energy sub-bands beyond the valence and conduction band edge. The current state-of-the-art methods to investigate the energy levels of nanocrystals are still having many limitation and technical complications. Moreover, all the device applications use cross-linked CNCs and there is the question whether the quantum confinement is still persisting in these assemblies of CNCs.  Here we report a new method to probe the quantized energy levels of colloidal nanocrystal assemblies by utilizing a new type of field-effect transistor devices. Ambipolar FET of PbS CNCs by using ionic-liquid-based gating has been demonstrated to achieve high carrier mobility values (mu; > 1 cm2/V.s) despite driven with only 1.5 V gate, since this gating technique can fill virtually all carrier traps due to the very high accumulated carrier density [4]. Because of the effective trap filling achieved with this gating technique, the Fermi energy level can be shift deep into the valence and conduction band to observe the band fillings.  By this method, we successfully electrically probed the band gap of the PbS CNCs of different diameters and the results are consistent with TEM, optical absorption measurement, as well as ab-initio calculation of the energy level. Most importantly, the band gap measurement was achieve electrically, and by combining the observation of the valence band and the conduction band from the FET measurements. Moreover, selecting specific ionic liquid gate materials we can access the higher energy sub-bands up to the third sub-band beyond the conduction band. Finally, by correlating experimental and theoretical results we can provide a comprehensive understanding of the electronic energy structure of nanocrystal films.Ref.: [1] K. Szendrei, M. A.

An alternative is electroless deposition (ELD) since it produces conformal, selective coatings at low temperature. ELD occurs by chemical reduction of metal ions without an externally applied potential. In the conventional approach, a metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd, or Ni is used that can be both expensive and increase the resistance of interconnect lines. Eliminating the catalyst reduces the cost and a possible source of contamination. Previous work was done using aqueous solutions and demonstrated low sheet resistance and good film continuity, but used a complexing agent or polymer to protect the particles (Armini and Caro, J. Electrochem. Soc. 2010, 157(1), D74-D80, doi: 10.1149/1.3258026 and Inoue et al. J. Electrochem. Soc. 2012, 159(7), D437-D441, doi: 10.1149/2.070207jes). In this paper, we report on a nonaqueous ELD process that uses a charge compensator, but not a ligand or complexing agent. The weak electrostatic attachment of the charge compensator to the ions and particles in solution and the high pH conditions improve the driving force for metal deposition. Si(100) coupons were hydroxylated using sulfuric acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM or piranha) followed by a sulfuric acid etch. The surface was terminated with an amine or mercapto group by immersing in a 4 mM solution of either (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS) or (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in methanol followed by a 423 K anneal. Metal films were deposited by suspending samples in a bath made by dissolving Cu(II) chloride in ethylene glycol, which also served as the reducing agent, and adding 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as a charge compensator. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Cu nanoparticles in the bath was at 585 nm, and the SPR of the film was attenuated in comparison after deposition. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the bath yielded a bimodal particle size distribution with peaks at 3-7 and 7-30 nm. Annealing the coupons at 473 K in nitrogen promoted the formation of an electrically conductive thin film. The sintered films showed little mass loss in an adhesion test. Scanning electron microscopy images of the coated substrates showed a bilayer structure consisting of a porous film that was 200-800 nm thick containing large 200-600 nm agglomerates on top of a void-free continuous film that was less than 300 nm thick. Electrical characterization of these films yielded conductivities ranging from 105-106 S/m. The Cu particle core-ion shell complex is attracted to the positively charged amine or mercapto groups at high pH depositing a thin metal film that is both continuous and cohesive. The method is both one-pot and does not require a catalyst.\n",

Quantum confined nanocrystals have a size tunable band gap, can be synthesized with near unity chemical yield, can be formed into solid state films using inexpensive casting or printing techniques, and embody unique photophysics that can lead to suppression of thermalization losses found in conventional semiconductor absorbers. In this talk, we will discuss devices made from either PbS, PbSe or CdTe nanocrystals where post-synthetic ligand exchange procedures using either organic or inorganic molecules are used to promote electronic coupling of quantum dots. Such ligand stripping has also been found to lead to midgap trap state formation which can be passivated with further QD surface treatment or incorporation of passivation ions during QD synthesis. We will discuss carrier transport in films made from nanocrystals, including trap states as well as band tail state distributions which appear to be surprisingly sharp for PbS given the degree of disorder in the array. Impressive overall efficiencies have been achieved due to attention to these concepts as well as understanding appropriate charge selective contacting schemes. Additionally we will discuss extracting more than one electron per incident high-energy photon due to multiple exciton generation.\n",

Despite this, it is only in recent years that a general consensus between experiment and theory has been reached as to the driving mechanism behind the transition. On the one hand, the large dimerizing (Peierls-like) structural distortion reinforces the relevance of the lattice, as well as imposing a limit on the timescale of the transition. On the other hand, much of the phase diagram requires the consideration of electron-electron correlations (i.e Mott-like). Here, we present experimental photoemission and soft x-ray spectroscopic evidence that the transition can be driven from a Peierls-like transition to a Mott-like transition by varying the applied strain of the lattice. Moderately-strained thin films of VO2, grown on oriented TiO2(001) and TiO2(110) substrates, exhibit signatures that are characteristic of the structural Peierls distortion (much like bulk VO2), principally owing to the large change in orbital occupation that accompanies the transition. For highly-strained VO2/TiO2(100), however, these hallmarks are absent, and the MIT resembles an electron driven Mott-like transition, i.e. without the large structural distortion. We suggest that such highly strained films may be valuable in circumventing the structural bottleneck in the timescale of the MIT in VO2.\n",

Despite a number of experimental evidences of superconductivity some properties are still unclear. For example, Raman spectra of such crystals have two main broad bands at 460-480 and 1220-1230 cm-1 which disagree with the cubic lattice. Instead, they are very similar with the Raman spectra of BC5 compounds [2]. Superconductivity of such boron carbide with the critical temperature Tc up to 45K was theoretically predicted [3]. We have grown 4-5 mm large single crystal heavily boron-doped diamonds by the temperature gradient method under high-pressure-high-temperature conditions [4, 5] and investigated their structure and electrical properties. We used X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, AFM analysis and micro-Raman scattering for the studies of structure and revealed thin, about 1 mu;m thick surface layer with hexagonal structure on the surface of cubic diamond. We cut ~100 mu;m plates with as-grown surface and investigated electrical conductivity of as-grown surface and the opposite one by 4-probe method down to 1.8K using Quantum Design PPMS EverCool-II system with magnetic field up to 9 Tesla. Chemical etching of the surface of heavily boron-doped diamond in ~100 nm depth drastically changed Raman spectra from broad bands to typical crystal diamond narrow line and defect-induced bands with boron content ~0.1 at% [6]. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity measured by the 4-probe method at as-grown (111) faces showed transition to superconductivity at Tc=2.5-3.5K as reported earlier [1]. However, the opposite side of the plate showed typical semiconductor R(T) behaviour with activation energy about 80 meV at room temperature and variable range hopping with high resistivity at T<220K. According to X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis the structure of the film is hexagonal. The Raman spectra can be attributed to nanometer-thick hexagonal diamond type lattice. The mean boron content in 1 mu;m depth measured by the wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy method was about 2.5 at.%. Thus we conclude that thin hexagonal boron carbide layer at the surface of boron-doped diamond is superconducting. 1. E.A. Ekimov, V.A. Sidorov, E.D. Bauer et al, Nature, 428 (2004) 542.2. V.L.

Inter-particle exchange interactions are absent, while dipolar interactions dominate. As a result, nanoparticle magnets behave differently from conventional magnets and their properties may be controlled and tuned by selecting the spacing and compositions of the constituent nanoparticles. We have studied dipolar interactions in self-assembled Cobalt nanoparticle magnets using off-axis electron holography in the transmission electron microscope. The technique enables the orientation and magnitude of the magnetic moment of each nanoparticle in an array to be determined and correlated with the structural properties of the meta-lattice, including the degree of order of the particles and their size distribution. Our study reveals that dipolar interactions are sufficiently strong to support long-range ferromagnetic order, even when the lattice of nanoparticles is highly disordered. This observation supports the possibility of creating amorphous dipolar magnets, in contrast to the expectation that a disordered dipolar system necessarily implies spin-glass behavior.Chain-like assemblies of 15 nm ε-Co particles were prepared with an oleic acid coating on a carbon substrate (with no external magnetic field applied). For chains that are wider than 1 particle across, the particles are typically assembled into triangular (close-packed) lattices, although square lattice arrangements are also occasionally seen. We used off-axis electron holography to map the projected magnetic fields of several elongated nanoparticle assemblies non-invasively with a nominal spatial resolution of 6.3 nm. The data set was acquired at remanence after applying an off-plane field of 2 T to the specimen, and reveals the magnetic moment topography of each chain directly.In order to quantify dipolar ferromagnetic order, we estimated the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moment of each individual particle. The measurements were correlated with the geometrical arrangements of the particles. For each pair of particles, we measured the spatial separation r between their centers and the angular difference Δtheta; between their moments, from which magnetic and lattice order parameters were determined. Our results show that short-range magnetic order with small domains dominates the initial states, with the local magnetic order (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) often depending on the particle lattice (triangular or square, respectively). In contrast, at remanence after saturation, overall dipolar ferromagnetic order persists even in case of a non-triangular lattice. We interpret our results as supporting the existence of amorphous dipolar ferromagnets: i.e., dipolar ferromagnetism in elongated nanoparticle assemblies even in the absence of underlying crystallinity.\n",

Fe nanoparticles with size around 20 nm have been shown to exhibit optimized superparamagnetic properties. Previous synthesis approach based on thermal decomposition of Fe(CO)5 in octadecene with oleylamine as surfactant results in Fe nanoparticles with size up to 15 nm. The superparamagnetic properties of these nanoparticles are confirmed with both AC and DC magnetic measurements. Here, we use microwave heating to synthesize Fe nanoparticles in the presence of polymers, and characterize the nanoparticle size using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Another approach is to synthesize the Fe nanoparticles with suitable ligands for further cross-linking between neighboring nanoparticles. The structural, chemical, and magnetic properties of these magnetic nanocomposites will be characterized by TEM, FTIR and AC magnetometry. Since inexpensive precursor Fe(CO)5, low reaction temperature (< 200°C) and short time (le; 30 min) are used in these experiments, which produce good magnetic properties, we believe that microwave-assisted synthesis of superparamagnetic Fe nanocomposite is a promising approach for high volume applications.\n",

For example Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) can have enormous deviations from nominal compositions yet still result in good performance. Unfortunately, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 contains elements that may constrain its large scale fabrication in the future, so development of the next generation of Earth-abundant absorbers with similar properties is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate defect tolerance in copper nitrides, a new class of next-generation Earth-abundant solar absorber materials, using a binary copper nitride Cu3N. This prototypical copper nitride material is known to have optical absorption and electrical transport properties that are reasonably suitable for solar absorber applications and achievable at low substrate temperature synthesis conditions: 1.5 eV absorption onset, 0.9 eV band gap and 10^15 - 10^17 p-type doping at ~100 C synthesis temperature.Defect tolerance of Cu3N is experimentally manifested by insensitivity of its electrical conductivity to the presence of point defects as well as low-angle and high-angle grain boundaries identified by the means of diffraction, microscopy and spectroscopy measurements. In the pure semiconducting Cu3N electrical conductivity is 10^-3 -10^-2 S/cm, regardless of these of crystallographic imperfections. Defect tolerance of electrical conductivity in Cu3N is theoretically supported by first principles calculations of point defects in this material. According to the theoretical results, Cu3N has no deep bulk point defects that can act as scattering centers for majority charge carriers in the experimental conductivity measurements or as recombination traps for minority charge carriers in solar energy conversion applications. We propose that the observed defect tolerance of electrical properties in Cu3N originates from its anti-bonding character of the valence band maximum. In semiconductors with such electronic structure, crystallographic defects states are likely to fall in the energy bands, not in the energy band gap. This in turn leads to effective-mass-like shallow defect states close to the band edges that cause minimal scattering to both majority and minority electric charge carrier transport. This explanation of defect tolerance in Cu3N invokes only the character of the involved atoms and their electronic energy states. Therefore, it is likely that other copper nitrides, in particular ternaries, will also have similar defect tolerant properties. This leads to a conclusion that copper nitrides are a new class of defect-tolerant next-generation Earth-abundant solar absorber materials.This research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as a part of a Next Generation PV II project “Ternary copper nitride absorbers” within the SunShot initiative.\n",

In particular, lead chalcogenide (PbX, X = S, Se, Te) NCs are prospective for photovoltaic applications where high power conversion efficiency has been demonstrated [1-2]. By changing the size of the NCs, the bandgap can be varied and the absorption edge can be tuned. Among the other unique properties of these NCs are the possibility to have multiple exciton generation (MEG), utilizing the discrete higher energy sub-bands formed by the quantum confinement of CNCs [3]. Therefore, a complete understanding of the energy levels of CNCs is necessary, not only the size dependent bandgap but also the complete picture of the energy sub-bands beyond the valence and conduction band edge. The current state-of-the-art methods to investigate the energy levels of nanocrystals are still having many limitation and technical complications. Moreover, all the device applications use cross-linked CNCs and there is the question whether the quantum confinement is still persisting in these assemblies of CNCs.  Here we report a new method to probe the quantized energy levels of colloidal nanocrystal assemblies by utilizing a new type of field-effect transistor devices. Ambipolar FET of PbS CNCs by using ionic-liquid-based gating has been demonstrated to achieve high carrier mobility values (mu; > 1 cm2/V.s) despite driven with only 1.5 V gate, since this gating technique can fill virtually all carrier traps due to the very high accumulated carrier density [4]. Because of the effective trap filling achieved with this gating technique, the Fermi energy level can be shift deep into the valence and conduction band to observe the band fillings.  By this method, we successfully electrically probed the band gap of the PbS CNCs of different diameters and the results are consistent with TEM, optical absorption measurement, as well as ab-initio calculation of the energy level. Most importantly, the band gap measurement was achieve electrically, and by combining the observation of the valence band and the conduction band from the FET measurements. Moreover, selecting specific ionic liquid gate materials we can access the higher energy sub-bands up to the third sub-band beyond the conduction band. Finally, by correlating experimental and theoretical results we can provide a comprehensive understanding of the electronic energy structure of nanocrystal films.Ref.: [1] K. Szendrei, M. A.

Quantum dots (QDs) based on compound semiconductors are promising materials for solar cells since the position of their exciton absorption bands can be tuned by selecting suitable semiconductor compositions, QD sizes and so on, thereby covering the entire solar spectral region. PbS quantum-dot-based solar cells with high efficiency in the near-IR region were constructed by combining ZnO nanowire arrays with PbS QDs, which give a first exciton absorption band centering at wavelengths longer than 1 mu;m. The 150-nm-thick and dense ZnO seed layers were first formed on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrates. Four different seed layers were deposited either by 1) spraying zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol (10mM) to the FTO glass substrate heated at 275 °C or 450 °C, 2) by spin-coating the zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol (0.5M) followed by thermal-treatment at 350 °C, or 3) by the combination of the two methods. The ZnO nanowire arrays with different thicknesses (from 500 to 1900 nm) were grown on the seed layers at 90 °C by a liquid-phase growth method. The entire inner space of the ZnO nanowire array was filled with PbS QDs by the spin-coating method. A flat PbS QD layer was then spin-coated onto the top surface of the PbS-QD:ZnO-nanowire hybrid layer, and the Au back contact was formed to complete the solar cell fabrication. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra of solar cells were measured using a monochromator equipped with a 150-W Xe-arc lamp. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW/cm2) using a Class-A solar simulator to obtain open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency. The J-V characteristic measurements were performed on the solar cells using a mask having a 2-mm-diameter aperture. All the measurements were carried out on the solar cells in air.The diameter and density of ZnO nanowires in the array depended on the surface structures of the seed ZnO layers. High light harvesting efficiency and efficient exciton diffusion were achieved by employing the 1200-nm-thick arrays composed of densely-grown ZnO nanowires (estimated density of 57 wires / mu;m2, and the average diameter of 26 nm) deposited on the surface of spin-coated ZnO seed layers. The QD-based solar cells gave the maximum IPCE of 58% in the near-IR region (@1020 nm), and the power conversion efficiency of 6.078% (Jsc = 34.47 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.361 V, FF = 0.488). Moreover, the solar cells were confirmed stable in air. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cells was found to be almost constant in the course of the 1000-h stability test carried out without illumination in air.\n",

However, their efficiencies remain low compared to their inorganic counterparts and the design and synthesis of the polymers are often arbitrary and laborious respectively. Furthermore, their structure-property relationships are little understood. New high-performing materials are required, but also, crucially, a rationale for why these materials are high-performing. Thus we have a dual approach: both novel chemistry and novel characterization. The former focuses on Rozen's reagent - a powerful oxidizing reagent that can generate thiophene-S,S-dioxides. The latter focuses on single molecule conductance measurements.Thiophene oxidation is an important reaction for organic electronics since molecules containig the thiophene-S,S-dioxide unit show a narrowed band gap and dramatically lowered LUMO. However, traditional oxidizing agents have failed to carry out this reaction efficiently. On the other hand, Rozen's reagent, a stable form of hypofluorous acid, can generate thiophene-S,S-dioxides at room temperature and in a matter of minutes. We are interested in developing this chemistry and incorporating these oxidized units into both small molecules and polymers.The question then remains as to how we can relate molecular structure to electronic behavior. In the past decade, wiring an individual molecule into a circuit has been realized. One means of achieving this is the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM-BJ) technique. Our group is interested in how this remarkable technique can be used to measure the conductance of molecular analogs of semiconducting polymers, with the aim of relating single molecule electronic properties to those in the bulk. We can apply this technique to our family of thiophene-S,S-dioxide containing materials and select the best performing materials for further exploration. In this way, we aim to develop design principles from these STM-BJ measurements so that we can strategically develop novel polymers. The combination of novel chemistry with novel characterization leads to a powerful design tool that could dramatically impact the organic photovoltaic community.\n",

Frederic  Laquai 1  Dominik  Gehrig 1  Steffen  Roland 3  Ian  Howard 1  Valentin  Kamm 1  Alex  Sharenko 2  Christopher  Proctor 2  Thuc-Quyen  Nguyen 2  Dieter  Neher 3  Klaus  Muellen 1  1Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research Mainz Germany2University of California Santa Barbara Santa Barbara USA3University of Potsdam Potsdam GermanyShow AbstractThe efficiency of single layer bulk heterojunction solar cells is heavily limited by the incomplete photon absorption of the rather thin photoactive layer. In particular the fullerene derivatives often used as electron acceptors in current state-of-the-art devices limit the maximum possible photocurrent due to the intrinsically low absorption of the fullerene molecules. Hence, substituting the ubiquitous fullerenes with strongly absorbing non-fullerene acceptor molecules is a promising way forward to overcome the present efficiency limits. However, at present the device performance of non-fullerene acceptors is still significantly lower than that of fullerene-based devices for reasons not understood at all. In this contribution we present recent insights into the efficiency-limiting processes in photovoltaic blends that use electron-rich polymers or small molecules as donors in combination with non-fullerene acceptors. Specifically, we report the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in a blend of a prototypic low-bandgap polymer (PBDTTT-C) and a perylene diimide (PDI) acceptor that has an efficiency of around 1.2 % and in which the blend&’s components exhibit complementary absorption spectra thereby covering the entire visible wavelength range up to 800 nm. Using broadband Vis-NIR transient pump-probe spectroscopy over a time range from femto- to milliseconds we show that after selective excitation of the polymer exciton dissociation into free charges is much slower compared to fullerene blends using the same donor polymer and thus a significant photocurrent loss due to exciton recombination occurs. Furthermore, charge transfer at the interface results in a large pool of coulombically-bound charge-transfer states, which undergo fast geminate recombination and hence are lost for photocurrent generation. Selective excitation of the PDI leads on the one hand to delayed hole transfer to the polymer, however, on the other hand also to exciton trapping in PDI excimers which is identified as an additional loss channel. Using time-delayed collection field experiments we also investigate the field dependence of free charge generation, which we compare to common polymer:fullerene blends. Furthermore, we demonstrate that free charges generated in the blend undergo non-geminate recombination on a timescale comparable to fullerene-based blends showing that these charges are sufficiently long-lived to be extracted as photocurrent from the device. We have very recently extended these experiments to other novel donor materials including state-of-the-art polymers such as PTB-7 as well as the small donor molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 which give 1.9 % PCE and 3.0 % PCE under optimized conditions, respectively. The importance of the individual photocurrent loss channels of the respective material systems is presented and potential solutions to overcome the efficiency limits are discussed.\n",

Imaging the morphology is however challenging due to the simultaneous requirements of good contrast between the phases and nanometer spatial resolution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is widely used for characterising thin-films at the nano-scale, but conventional imaging does not produce any appreciable contrast, due to both donor and acceptor being carbon-rich. In conventional imaging all transmitted electrons are used to form the image. If however only electrons that have excited a plasmon within the thin-film are selected the resulting image is found to have significant contrast. The contrast improvement is due to damping of the plasmon excitation in PCBM acceptor by interband transitions of similar energy, so that for the same material volume the PCBM plasmon intensity is lower than the donor (in this case P3HT polymer).These so-called ‘plasmon-loss&’ images contain a wealth of information about the BHJ morphology. For example, (semi-) crystalline fibres of P3HT with length of several 100 nm and diameter of only a few nm are revealed; the fibre geometry is ideal for optimising both charge generation and collection, provided the fibre is aligned along the film thickness direction. The region around the fibres was filled with molecular PCBM, as required for an efficient device. The presence of PCBM can be deduced by analysing the shape of the plasmon peak (PCBM has a shoulder at smaller energies due to interband transitions). Residual chlorobenzene solvent pockets, only a few nm in diameter, were also observed throughout the thin-film, and showed a higher concentration of PCBM, due to its preferential solubility. The PCBM density within the solvent pockets was however lower, as revealed by the red shift of the plasmon peak. Electron tomography was used to visualise the morphology in 3D. A new method that takes into account the non-linear dependence of the plasmon signal w.r.t projected thickness of the specimen was developed for generating accurate tomography reconstructions. Plasmon-loss imaging will also be used to investigate the role of thermal annealing on morphology evolution in real time; preliminary results from in-situ annealing will be reported at the conference.\n",

Unfortunately, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 contains elements that may constrain its large scale fabrication in the future, so development of the next generation of Earth-abundant absorbers with similar properties is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate defect tolerance in copper nitrides, a new class of next-generation Earth-abundant solar absorber materials, using a binary copper nitride Cu3N. This prototypical copper nitride material is known to have optical absorption and electrical transport properties that are reasonably suitable for solar absorber applications and achievable at low substrate temperature synthesis conditions: 1.5 eV absorption onset, 0.9 eV band gap and 10^15 - 10^17 p-type doping at ~100 C synthesis temperature.Defect tolerance of Cu3N is experimentally manifested by insensitivity of its electrical conductivity to the presence of point defects as well as low-angle and high-angle grain boundaries identified by the means of diffraction, microscopy and spectroscopy measurements. In the pure semiconducting Cu3N electrical conductivity is 10^-3 -10^-2 S/cm, regardless of these of crystallographic imperfections. Defect tolerance of electrical conductivity in Cu3N is theoretically supported by first principles calculations of point defects in this material. According to the theoretical results, Cu3N has no deep bulk point defects that can act as scattering centers for majority charge carriers in the experimental conductivity measurements or as recombination traps for minority charge carriers in solar energy conversion applications. We propose that the observed defect tolerance of electrical properties in Cu3N originates from its anti-bonding character of the valence band maximum. In semiconductors with such electronic structure, crystallographic defects states are likely to fall in the energy bands, not in the energy band gap. This in turn leads to effective-mass-like shallow defect states close to the band edges that cause minimal scattering to both majority and minority electric charge carrier transport. This explanation of defect tolerance in Cu3N invokes only the character of the involved atoms and their electronic energy states. Therefore, it is likely that other copper nitrides, in particular ternaries, will also have similar defect tolerant properties. This leads to a conclusion that copper nitrides are a new class of defect-tolerant next-generation Earth-abundant solar absorber materials.This research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as a part of a Next Generation PV II project “Ternary copper nitride absorbers” within the SunShot initiative.\n",

Fischer 1  Isa L. Ferrall 1  Stephen M. Ubnoske 1  Brian R. Stoner 2  Jeffrey T. Glass 1  1Duke University Durham USA2RTI International Durham USAShow AbstractAtomic layer deposition (ALD) offers the ability to uniformly deposit conformal films over high aspect ratio nanostructure scaffolds. This makes ALD particularly well-suited for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications, where thin photoactive film coatings can maximize the effective absorption length and also minimize the charge carriers&’ path length to the interface with the electrolyte. Although the deposition of TiO2 films over such scaffolds has been shown to vastly improve PEC performance, the large bandgap intrinsic to TiO2 still prevents such devices from harvesting more of the solar spectrum. To overcome this problem, substitutional N-doping into TiO2&’s oxygen vacancy sites by NH3 treatments has shown promise in narrowing the bandgap and promoting visible light absorption. However, the overall effect of such doping on TiO2 PEC performance is still not well understood, especially for thin ALD films. We report on a systematic study of the effects of NH3 calcination treatment conditions on the performance of TiO2 films less than 50 nm thick for the purpose of water oxidation. The amount and type of nitrogen incorporation are characterized as a function of depth by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the chemical compositions of the as-deposited surfaces of select films are characterized by in-vacuo XPS. The surface versus bulk charge transfer effects, flatband voltages, and donor concentrations are analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The combination of these tools provides insight into the consequences of nitridation and enables the development of optimal thickness and treatment conditions for N:TiO2 films. Specifically, this presentation summarizes how NH3 treatments that are successful in substitutionally incorporating nitrogen into the TiO2 lattice can also introduce detrimental surface defects that are more pronounced as the film thickness decreases. In comparison, the introduction of N atoms into the bulk of the film does not have such a strong influence on PEC performance. The fundamental understanding of these N doping effects enables engineering of semiconductor films that can be integrated onto nanostructured scaffold for superior PEC performance.\n",

Herein, we introduce a novel heterogeneous catalyst for H2-generation from FA, using a Fe-complex (Diphenylphospine/Fe(BF4)2), covalently immobilized on SiO2 particles. Catalytic H2 production from FA takes place at near-ambient temperatures (60-100 C) with high selectivity and activity. The present data show that a novel heterogeneneous Fe-PPh2@SiO2 catalyst is a remarkable system with regard to H2 generation from FA. The catalyst shows excellent stability and reusability, being able to generate up to 7lt of H2 within 7.5 hours. Advanced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopic methodologies including Parallel-Mode EPR and 2-dimensional HYSCORE Pulsed EPR spectroscopy allow direct monitoring of the catalytic centers. Detailed thermodynamic data reveal that a synergistic mechanism exists where the particle-oxide surface enhances the H2 generation by lowering the energy-barrier of the Arrhenius activation step by ΔEpsi;=4-6kJ/mole.

Consequently, fabricating ZnO nanostructures with different sizes and morphologies is of great importance for fundamental research and the development of novel devices. To date, various ZnO nanostructures have been successfully synthesized, including quantum dots, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, nanorings, nanocups, nanodisks, nanoflowers, nanonails, nanospheres, and hierarchical nanostructures. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanorods have high surface area and good dispersibility in solution rate, which enable them to act as promising photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals degradation. Mechanochemical or solid-state reactions are particularly suitable for the large-scale production of nanoparticles because of their simplicity and low cost. Because such reactions do not involve organic solvents, they are attractive from an environmental point of view.  In the present study, ZnO nanorods with good crystallinity were synthesized by michanical assisted thermal decomposition method. The as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) together with an energy dispersion X-ray spectrum analysis (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and UV-visible spectra. The hexagonal structure of ZnO was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The nanorods shape and size have been identified through FESEM and TEM. The TEM show that most of the nanorods have straight sides and regular ends. We examined the crystallographic nature of the individual ZnO nanorod using HRTEM observations and SAED. Taking all TEM images, HRTEM and SAED into account, the real shape of the nanorod can be approximately reconstructed, in which the axial direction is [001]. The results indicate that the ZnO nanorod grows along the [001] direction and expose their {10-10} facets.  The photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanorods were evaluated by the methylene blue (MB) degradation in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalysis experiments demonstrated that high aspect ratio rods showed significantly higher visible light photocatalytic activity when compared to the lower aspect ratio structures. Compared with the HRTEM and photocatalysis experiments, the higher expose fraction of {10-10} facets leading to better visible-light photodegradation. It is proposed that higher activity is due to better charge separation in the elongated 1D structure.\n",

Notably, the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) exhibits an exceptionally low thermal conductivity < 0.05 W m-1 K-1. The majority of prior work on organic thermoelectric has focused on hole conducting materials; however, development of all-organic thermoelectric devices requires a viable n-type leg as well. Due to their large band gap(asymp; 2 eV), and small electron affinity (asymp; -3 to -4 eV), extrinsic n-type doping of organic semiconductors to sufficient carrier concentrations for thermoelectric applications (~10^19 cm^-3) is challenging. Here we present studies of the thermoelectric properties of n-type organic semiconductors extrinsically doped with molecular dopants. The systems presented here here are processed entirely in solution, and thus offer potential for fabrication via printing methods. We have studied the electrical properties of the high performance polymer, poly{N,N&’-bis(2-octyl-dodecyl)-1,4,5,8-napthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5&’-(2,2&’-bithiophene)} (P(NDIOD-T2)), doped by dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl derivatives that act as donors; however, we estimate that less than 1% of donors are active due to limited solid solubility of the molecular dopant in the polymer. Nonetheless, we achieve thermoelectric power factors ~ 0.1 µWm^-1K^-2 by extrinsically doping P(NDIOD-T2) to an estimated carrier concentration of 10^18 cm^-3 with these molecular donors, values consistent with prior results for hole-conducting organic semiconductors doped to comparable carrier concentrations. Additionally, we will present results on doping of PCBM, a solution processable fullerene, with a novel fullerene-based molecular donor. We propose design rules for candidate n-type organic thermoelectric materials based on our results.\n",

Atlanta USA3Korea Institute of Science and Technology Seoul Republic of KoreaShow AbstractNew battery materials may allow one to achieve energy densities higher than that of the commercial Li-ion batteries. Sulfur (S) is an attractive cathode material due to its high theoretical gravimetric capacity (1672 mAh g-1), low cost, and environment friendliness. However, S cathodes have several key challenges to be overcome to become commercialy viable technology. When the S is confined within the nanospace of C, these limitations can be alleviated [1]. In spite of significant efforts, surprisingly limited understanding exists on the effects of physical structural parameters of carbon in Li/S battery. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to reveal the impacts of the pore size distribution, pore volume and specific surface area of porous carbons on the temperature-dependent electrochemical performance of S-infiltrated carbon cathodes in electrolytes having different salt concentration. In order to make this study most relevant to industrial needs, we used low-cost commercial AC samples for S-C composite fabrication and evaluation, The selected ACs have been produced from natural precursors and exhibit markedly different porosity characteristics.At atmospheric temperature operation of the cells, the accessible capacities of S-infiltrated ACs containing larger pores were found to be significantly higher than that of the S infiltrated into microporous ACs having smaller pore size and stronger interactions with sulfur and sulfides. In contrast, however, the microporous ACs provided higher capacity at the elevated temperature due to improved ion transport rate. The dissolution of polysulfide was also reduced in ACs containing smaller pores. The effect of electrolyte molarity on the performance of Li/S cells was found to depend on the AC pore size and particle size. Increasing electrolyte salt concentration from 1 to 3M was found to improve the cell performance and reduce polysulfide dissolution in all the studied S-C samples. However, further increasing electrolyte molarity and, as a result, increasing electrolyte viscosity was found to lead to high polarization and reduce the cell performance in ACs having large particle size or smaller pores.

Atlanta USA4Korea Institute of Science and Technology Seoul Republic of KoreaShow AbstractSulfur (S) is considered to be one of the candidates for the next generation cathodes due to its high theoretical gravimetric capacity, low cost and its abundance in nature [1]. While this capacity is an order of magnitude higher than that of existing commercial electrode materials, S cathodes still have several challenges to overcome for successful commercialization. The use of carbide derived carbon (CDC) for sulfur(S) nano-confinement can be greatly advantageous because of the precise tuning of the pore size distribution possible by both selecting different carbide precursors and changing the process parameters during the synthesis of such carbon materials [2].  Novel nanostructured S-CDC composites having ordered mesopores and high S content have been successfully prepared for lithium sulfur batteries. Higher CDC synthesis temperature and the resulting lower concentration of defects and higher purity was found to allow for higher S content, higher capacity utilization and better rate capability of S-CDC cathodes. The opportunity to independently tune the size of both the CDC micropores and straight, aligned mesopores suggest a great promise of CDC technology for both the fundamental studies and practical applications. In contrast to commercial activated carbon power, the dual pore size distribution in CDC allow for the high rate performance and provides sufficient freedom to study the impact of electrolyte composition. In our study, higher electrolyte molarity was found to greatly enhance capacity utilization and reduce S dissolution in S-CDC composite cathodes, thereby overcoming the key challenges of S/Li chemistry. Due to the presence of straight mesopore channels combined with high micropore content in CDC, the produced S-CDC cathodes not only demonstrated nearly theoretical capacity in 5M electrolyte solution, but also showed outstanding resistance to dissolution.

Biological energy transduction mechanism hints at the construction of a man-made energy storage system. Since the pioneering work by Tarascon et al.[1] towards a sustainable lithium rechargeable battery received significant resonance, organic materials such as carbonyl, carboxyl, or quinone-based compounds have been demonstrated to be bio-inspired organic electrodes.[2, 3] The imitation of redox-active plastoquinone and ubiquinone cofactors[4] through the utilization of redox active C=O functionalities in organic electrodes is a significant step-forward to biomimetic energy storage. However, the biological energy transduction is based on numerous redox centers of versatile functionalities available in nature, not limited to the simple redox active C=O functionalities. Consideration of how natural energy transduction systems function at organelle or cellular levels by elucidating the basic components and their operating principles selected by evolution will enrich the biomimetic strategy for efficient and green energy storage.Herein, we propose new-type of redox active organic molecules containing C=N functionality, where most interest in organic electrodes has focused on the molecules with C=O functionalities, such as carbonyl, carboxylate, or quinone-based molecules [5]. Flavins, a key redox element in respiration and photosynthesis, facilitate either one- or two-electron-transfer redox processes accompanying proton transfer at nitrogen atoms of diazabutadiene motif during cellular metabolism. We have discovered that the protonation sites of a riboflavin molecule can capture two lithium ions reversibly exhibiting a high capacity of 174 mAh/g, which is comparable to that of LiFePO4. The combined ex situ characterizations and density-functional theory(DFT)-based calculation revealed that the redox reaction occurs via the two successive single-electron transfer steps at nitrogen atoms of diazabutadiene motif, which is analogous to the proton-coupled electron transfer of flavoenzymes in nature. We also demonstrated that the capacity and voltage can be tuned by the substitution of flavin cofactors, which opens up new principles in electrode design. This kind of bio-electrode is particularly unprecedented for lithium rechargeable batteries. [1] H. Chen, M. Armand, G. Demailly, F. Dolhem, P. Poizot, J.M. Tarascon, ChemSusChem 2008, 1, 348.[2] Z.

Sheldon 1  1Brown University Providence USA2Medtronic Minneapolis USAShow AbstractHigh voltage Ta capacitors have broad applications for energy storage in electric systems, where there are very strict requirements for stability and reliability. In situ stress measurements were employed to provide new insight into failure mechanisms in these materials. In particular, field induced crystallization of the capacitor dielectric at high voltages was investigated in detail. This work demonstrates that different mechanisms produce both tensile and compressive stresses during the operation of these materials. The magnitude of these stresses is large enough to substantially impact observed failure processes. Stresses are generated in the amorphous tantalum oxide (ATO)/Ta system during operation by hydration process, electrophoresis, further oxidization and crystallization. These stresses have been evaluated by in situ stress measurement on a thin film model system. Futhermore, the details and direct evidences of failure process of ATO under high electric field have also been investigated in this report. Stress results are paired with data from techniques including focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out, electron scanning microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area diffraction (SAD), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to explore the details and to provide direct evidence for the failure mechanism. Based on this series of results, the failure mechanism has been reassessed. This will guide the new approaches for improving the stability and reliability of Ta capacitor in future and open a door to study the failure mechanism of other capacitors.1 School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA. 2 Medtronic Energy and Components Center, 6800 Shingle Creek Parkway, Brooklyn Center, MN 55430, USA. a suxin81@gmail.com, b mark.viste@medtronic.com, c joachim.hossick-schott@medtronic.com, e brian_sheldon@brown.edu. * Corresponding author, B.W.

Perry 1  1Georgia Tech Atlanta USA2Georgia Tech Atlanta USA3Naval Research Laboratory Washington USAShow AbstractOrganic-inorganic hybrid sol-gel materials containing polar groups that can undergo reorientational polarization under an electric field provide a potential route to processable, high permittivity dielectric materials for energy storage. We have shown that sol-gel thin films based on neat 2-cyanoethyltrimethoxysilane (CNETMS) exhibit large permittivity (~20) and an extractable energy density of 7 J/cm3 at ~300 V/µm. In this work, we have investigated the influence of a thin polymeric film “blocking” layer deposited on the CNETMS on the breakdown statistics and the energy storage characteristics. Two polymeric materials, a fluoropolymer (CYTOP) and poly(p-phenylene oxide) (PPO), were examined as potential materials to block charge injection into neat CNETMS films. Blocking layers with thicknesses ranging from 20 nm to 176 nm were deposited on top of CNETMS film by spin casting. The bilayer films exhibit a decrease of permittivity as well as loss tangent as a result of the introduction of low-k organic layer at frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Interestingly, PPO/CNETMS bilayer films show an order of magnitude reduction in leakage current compared to neat CNETMS films, which suggests the utility of PPO in blocking charge injection into neat CNETMS film. Energy density measurements using the charge-discharge method show an increase of 25% in extractable energy density with PPO/CNETMS bilayer films due to improved breakdown strength. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements show that PPO/CNETMS bilayer films exhibit comparable maximum extractable energy density to neat CNETMS. Additionally, unlike CYTOP/CNETMS bilayer, the dielectric loss of PPO/CNETMS bilayer films derived from P-E loops exhibits a plateau at fields from 200 to 500 V/µm, which suggests trapped charges in PPO and at the PPO/CNETMS interface at these fields undergo interfacial polarization along with reorientational polarization of neat CNETMS. The observed results will be discussed in regards to film morphology, partitioning of electric field, charge trapping, and loss of bilayer films. Our study indicates that: 1) the blocking layer provides enhanced breakdown strength to bilayer films, 2) the extractable energy density and energy extraction efficiency of bilayer films depend on the trapped charges in blocking layer and the interface between blocking and CNETMS layer.\n",

Lyons 1  1City University of New York Staten Island USAShow AbstractOrganic dye molecules in industrial wastewater pose special challenges as the molecules are relatively stable and resistant to many conventional abatement techniques. Weathering of organic dyes can produce toxic metabolites, conventional biological treatment processes are not effective, and adsorption and coagulation practices are expensive and causes secondary pollution.[1-3] The use of advanced photooxidation processes offer a more promising technological approach to the destruction of organic pollutants. In this process, sunlight and a semiconducting metal oxide catalyst combine to photooxidize dyes and other organic molecules to CO2. Usually, the photocatalyst is used in the form of nanopowders or nanofilms.[3] Photocatalytic films, where catalyst particles are immobilized on a surface, offer advantages over dispersed particulates as they can be used directly, and in continuous systems, for purifying water under illumination. However, the main problem with the photocatalytic films is their reduced surface area and thus efficiency. In addition, a static boundary layer forms when fluids flow over the surface. Thus dye molecules would need to diffuse across this static boundary layer before they could come into contact with the catalytic surface. In this study we designed a superhydrophobic surface with catalytic particles partially embedded into the surface to reduce the static boundary layer while achieving good contact between the catalytic particles and the solution.We used an inexpensive template lamination method to fabricate a TiO2-polyethylene nanocomposite surface that exhibits stable superhydrophobic properties without chemical surface modification of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Hierarchical roughness, spanning the micro to nano scale range, was formed onto the surface by using a template to emboss the polyethylene surface creating an array of polymeric posts while partially embedding TiO2 nanoparticles selectively into the top surface of these raised features. The TiO2 nanoparticles on the film surface absorb organic compounds from a droplet as it slips across the surface. The absorbed molecules are photoxidized under UV light and are replenished when the next droplet contacts the surface and the process repeats. The embossed region of the surface contains no TiO2 particles and so remains hydrophobic, contributing to the stability of the superhydrophobic properties. The ability of droplets to slip along the surface minimize the static solid-liquid boundary layer and we have demonstrated that this hierarchical surface significantly increases the degradation rates of dye molecules compared to static process. 1.

Hedrick 2  Yi Yan Yang 1  1Institute of Biotechnology and Nanotechnology Singapore Singapore2IBM Research - Almaden San Jose USAShow AbstractChemical coatings on medical catheters are either antimicrobial or antifouling in nature, they are rarely both. However, coatings that consist exclusively of one given type of material have major drawbacks. For example, catheters with antimicrobial polymer coating may encourage sedimentation of dead bacteria cells, and this may provide a foothold for surviving bacteria to flourish [1]. Moreover, catheters coated solely with antifouling polymer may in the long run fail to prevent the bacteria from fouling the modified catheter surface once the bacteria eventually overcome the surface chemistry [1-2]. In this study, we show that by developing polymers with both antibacterial and antifouling functions, we can produce a coated surface that prevents bacterial fouling for a long period of time. A series of polymers consisting of a polycarbonate backbone and random cationic pendant groups were synthesized via metal-free organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization. MPEG of various molecular weights were incorporated into the polymer as the initiator, and the respective polymers were grafted covalently onto silicone surfaces under ambient conditions. The study showed that surface coated with polymer containing 10 kDa MPEG proved to be most effective against S. aureus, and resisted bacteria surface fouling for a duration of 2 weeks. Moreover, surface coated with polymer having 2.4 kDa MPEG prevented E. coli fouling most extensively among the series of polymers synthesized. The surfaces coated with this particular series of synthesized polymers were also able to resist protein fouling and platelet adhesion, and did not cause significant hemolysis. In conclusion, this series of MPEG incorporated cationic polymers hold great potential as both antifouling and antimicrobial coating against selective bacteria, and to reduce the prevalence of catheter-associated bloodstream infections.References (1) Banerjee, I.; Pangule, R.

Therefore, specifically designed mechanical tests on single and oligocrystalline microsamples were performed and combined with SEM, EBSD, TEM and X-ray microdiffraction techniques. In the present work, microsamples were studied under different loading conditions: compression, bending, and torsion. The samples for bending and compression experiments were fabricated out of 1-4µm thick Ag thin films epitaxially grown onto Si wafer substrates. Via conventional cleanroom processing they were shaped into microbeams and micropillars. The size of the beams ranges from 10µm x 5µm up to 40µm x 20µm, whereas the pillars are 0,5µm up to 5µm in diameter. In both cases the load was applied using a nanoindenter system. Au wires having 15 to 60 µm in diameter were used for torsion experiments. In contrast to the compression and bending samples, the Au wires were polycrystalline and have been heat treated to form a pronounced bamboo microstructure. To study the microstructural changes due to plastic deformation various methods with high lateral resolution were applied. The main tools for bending and compression in this context are EBSD and TEM. The micro-wires were cut by FIB at selected cross sections and the analyzed via micro Laue diffraction and EBSD. Comparative measurements of deformed an initial microstructures allowed both to display the distribution of the dislocation density and strain gradients and an estimation of their absolute values. The results will be discussed with respect to the influence of crystal orientation and loading condition on the evolution of local strain fields and dislocation microstructure.\n",

Organic resists offer the versatility of the lithography process known from the CMOS environment and simultaneously ensure a highly stable and low wear tip-sample contact due to the relatively soft nature of the resists. Patterning quality is excellent up to a resolution of sub 15 nm [1], at linear speeds of up to 20 mm/s and pixel rates of up to 500 kHz.[3] In addition, the patterning depth is proportional to the applied force which allows for the creation of 3-D profiles in a single patterning run.[2] For reliable patterning at high speed and high resolution an efficient control system is essential. Here I will discuss how we implemented a closed-loop lithography control scheme. We obtain the control signals by reading the topography in the retrace motion of the scan, while writing is performed during the trace motion. We use the acquired data to optimize the position stability in vertical direction, the amplitude and offset of the applied writing force and the applied force during reading. Excellent control of all parameters is important for an accurate reproduction of complex 3D patterns. Here we demonstrate that depth levels are reproduced with an error of less than 1 nm.These novel patterning capabilities are equally important for a high quality transfer of two-dimensional patterns into the underlying substrate. We utilize an only 3-4 nm thick SiOx hardmask to amplify the 8±0.5 nm deep patterns created by tSPL into a 50 nm thick transfer polymer. The structures in the transfer polymer can be used to create metallic lines by a lift-off process or to further process the pattern into the substrate. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of 27 nm wide lines and trenches 60 nm deep into the Silicon substrate. The line-edge roughness is 2.7 nm (3sigma) at a write-pixel-pitch of 9 nm, which enables high throughput fabrication of high resolution structures. The high quality of the transferred patterns is a direct consequence of the 0.5 nm RMS depth control during writing and the high etch selectivity of the SiOx mask. The demonstrated feature density and line-edge roughness fulfill today&’s requirements for mask-less lithography for example for the fabrication of EUV-masks.Acknowledgment: This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and by the European Union&’s Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no 318804 (SNM).[1] D.

The magnetism is governed by the balance between ferromagnetic Cr-Se-Cr superexchange and numerous next neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions, which are relatively easy tuned by doping. Numerous useful properties can be generated by a proper selection of dopant like colossal magnetoresistance or increased Seebeck effect. Of a special interest is doping with 4f metals due to their high localized magnetic moment. Our investigations aim to describe how the introduction of dysprosium and neodymium changes the basis properties of the matrix.The polycrystalline compounds ZnCr1.95Dy0.05Se4 and ZnCr1.95Nd0.05Se4 were prepared by ceramic method according to chemical reactions: ZnSe + 0.975Cr2Se3 + 0.25Dy2Se3 = ZnCr1.95Dy0.05Se4 (1)ZnSe + 0.975Cr2Se3 + 0.25Nd2Se3 = ZnCr1.95Nd0.05Se4 (2)The stoichiometric quantities of binary selenides were sintered twice in silica ampoules for 240h at 1173K.

Smith 1  Marcus L. Young 1  Kevin  Tucker 2  Mark  Leonard 2  John  Dennis 2  1University of North Texas Denton USA2Dallas Museum of Art Dallas USAShow AbstractKnowledge of the composition of modern American Ag and Ag-plated cultural heritage objects is limited, resulting in many unanswered questions in regards to the provenance, composition, and production methods. In this paper, the author&’s objective is to determine the bulk metal and, when present, plating compositions of Ag and Ag-plated objects of importance to the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA). One of the major challenges with studying ancient and modern cultural heritage and art objects is that they must be non-destructively and non-invasively examined, which often requires a combination of analytical techniques for full characterization. Analytical techniques such as conventional X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence allow for surface studies of the objects, but cannot examine the bulk material; furthermore, these surface studies can be misleading since many objects have alterations on the surface such as corrosion layers, tarnishes, patinas, plating, and post-excavation cleaning. While studies on the bulk material can be performed non-destructively using synchrotron, neutron, and proton sources only available at large user facilities, only a few select objects can be examined at one time due to the nature of these facilities.By using a FEI Nova 200 Nanolabs dual beam ultra-high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) / focused ion beam (FIB) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), it is possible to examine a large number of objects quickly and efficiently. In this presentation, we show, for the first time, that this novel FIB technique can be successfully applied non-destructively to cultural heritage objects by examining three representative Ag-plated objects (a Candelabra, “Century” spoon, and New York World&’s Fair spoon) from the DMA&’s unparalleled collection of Modern American Silver. In each case, we successfully reveal and characterize the bulk metal as well as the Ag-plating, up to ~50 µm thick and show that there is no significant visual damage resulting from the milling process of the FIB. It can easily be foreseen that this novel characterization technique can be applied, due to its ease of availability and rapid use, in a much broader scope rather than just Ag-plated objects, making FIB a cornerstone technique in the field.\n",

Heffner 1  Shera  Demchak 2  Raymond  Pearson 1  John W. Scruggs 3  1Lehigh University Bethlehem USA2University Of MA Amherst USA3Tuskegee Institute Tuskegee USAShow AbstractThermal conductivity is an important property in the materials selection for many applications, and the values are well known for the common engineering materials. However for the material scientist making new formulations, such as glass-polymer composites, thermal conductivity data will not be known and an experimental determination will be required. For insulating materials, the Modulated DSC Method [1] is one common ASTM approved approach for measuring thermal conductivity in the range of 0.1 to 1.5 W/m°K. However, a simpler, low-cost method could provide a much broader access for students and researchers to this important property. As a part of our larger effort to develop inexpensive apparatus for students to engage in “real” material science and research, we have designed and built an apparatus for the accurate measurement of the thermal conductivities of glass and polymer samples. It is simple to construct, consisting of a heated aluminum block placed on the top side of the flat sample, and two tiered pedestal base on the cold side which provides an independent measurement of heat flow through the sample. Differential thermocouples pairs are used to sense both the temperature difference across the sample as well as the heat following through the base pedestal. Two inexpensive instrumentation amplifier ICs are used to convert the small signal from the thermocouples into a voltage range appropriate for measurement with a conventional meter. The cost of parts for the basic apparatus is less than $100 and requires only modest mechanical and electronic fabrication skills. A home-built vacuum chamber has also been included as an improved option for the apparatus. A good correlation was obtained for a collection of glass and plastic materials with thermal conductivity ranging from 0.15 to 1.1 W/m°K. We also measured the thermal conductivity of a silica filled epoxy and showed a linear increase with fill fraction to 20%. Finally, we also measured thermal conductivities using the ASTM standard MDSC Method on a TA Q2000 Modulated DSC for comparison. Our apparatus was found to be much simpler to use and gave more consistent sample to sample variation than the MDSC approach.1.

Galvao 1  1State University of Campinas Campinas-SP BrazilShow AbstractMembranes are very important structures for a large variety of scientific and technological applications. They can be used as selective barriers and play an important role in processes such as; cellular compartmentalization, industrial-scale chemical, gas and water purifications, etc. [1-3].Recently, it was proposed that graphene sheets could act as impermeable atomic membranes to standard gases, such as helium, argon, and nitrogen [1]. For some other applications, a higher level of porosity is needed. In part due to this, there is a renewed interest in investigating graphene-like porous structures.One of these structures is the so-called biphenylene carbon (BPC) [4], which is a porous two-dimensional (planar) allotrope carbon form. BPC has a quite interesting topology with its pores resembling typical sieve cavities and/or some kind of zeolites.In this work we have used classical molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of gas permeation through these membranes and possible selectivity effects to specific compounds. For comparison purposes we have considered perfect few-layer graphene membranesThe simulations were carried out mimicking the experimental conditions [1], where a nanochamber of silicon oxide if filled with different gases and sealed by the membranes (graphene and BPC). By increasing the gas temperature and/or pressure inside/outside the chamber we analyzed the processes of whether there are gas leakages between the membranes and the substrates and the dynamics of these leakages. For the graphene membrane we did not observe any gas leakage through the membrane/substrate interface until the critical limit is reached and then a sudden membrane detachment occurs. These results are consistent with the available experimental data [1-2]. For the case when the BPC is used as a selective membrane we observe different leak rates for different gases (helium, argon). The leakage dynamics is also much more complex than in the case of graphene membranes. We have also investigated the necessary conditions to use these membranes to separate gas mixtures.[1] J. S.

One-dimensional nanomaterials of SnO2 has emerged as one of the potential materials exhibiting better crystallinity, sensitivity and higher selectivity for detection of low concentrations of pollutant gases under low operating temperatures due to its wide band gap (3.6 eV), as well as a low production cost, high porosity, environmentally gentle and abundant nature. So far, graphene-based gas sensors have been reported for detection of various gas species such as NO2, NH3, CO, CO2, O2, and H2, possessing high durability, reliability, and reproducibility. However, the large-scale production of practical sensors based on these materials is still limited due to their high cost. In this present study, efforts have been ongoing to focus on the effects of morphology, reduction degree, and device fabrication of graphene-SnO2 composites on selectivity, sensitivity, and recovery properties of detector devices by following the simple hydrothermal process. The length (~30 mu;m) diameter (~70nm) and surface morphology can be easily tuned by choosing the precursor material and varying the concentration and reaction time. In a typical procedure, the alkoxide was transformed into a chain-like, glycolate complex that subsequently crystallized into uniform SnO2-GO composite nanowires. The SnO2-RGO nanowire array structures exhibited excellent response to target gases at room temperature (detection limit of 1 ppm for NO2) in comparison with SnO2-graphene flakes, GO-SnO2 nanoparticles and pure SnO2-based sensors. We strongly believe that different morphological nanostructure SnO2/graphene-based materials will open new opportunities for improving the sensitivity as well as selectivity for gas sensor applications. The screening of different gas sensing (NH3, H2S) studies is under progress.\n",

Grigoropoulos 1  1University of California, Berkeley Berkeley USA2Kookmin University Seoul Republic of Korea3Kyung Hee University Yongin Republic of KoreaShow AbstractSubstantial technological progress has been achieved in the field of ‘flexible/stretchable electronics&’, including flexible displays, human-inspired electronics, and wearable electronics. The advances in materials process for flexible/stretchable electronics, including flexible substrates, stretchable metal interconnects, and low temperature process (< 100°C), achieved a significant progress in bendable and conformal thin-film transistors (TFTs). In spite of the many capabilities of the conventional TFTs based on amorphous silicon (a-Si), low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS), organic semiconductors, and oxide semiconductors, the fragility and low mobility of these materials limit their utility in flexible/stretchable electronic circuits. Hence, the reliable performance of these devices requires a novel semiconductor material that can provide mechanical stability and high mobility. In this regard, TFTs based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, demonstrated the potential to overcome the drawbacks of conventional TFTs, because of their relatively high mobility (>100 cm2/Vs), large bandgap (~1.35 eV), mechanical flexibility. The combination of their high carrier mobility, atomic thickness, and significant band gaps offers an exciting new pathway to practical nanoscale electronics.  However, there are several key challenges that lie ahead before the transistors based on 2D layered semiconductors can be integrated into flexible/stretchable circuits. The key challenges include inaccessibility of low contact resistance for high performance transistor, and a low thermal budget (< 200 C) of the typical flexible substrate (e.g. PEN, PET, and PI films). That is, conventional thermal process cannot be applied to lower contact resistance at a schottky barrier between metal and a semiconducting MoS2. In order to achieve high mobility MoS2 TFTs on flexible substrate, the pulse laser is promising technology because it can induce thermal effect at locally confined a selective area that needs high temperature without extreme thermal damage.  In this study, we will show that mechanical flexible MoS2 TFT in which the source/drain electrodes are selectively annealed using picosecond laser annealing achieve the enhancement of device performance without plastic deformation, such as higher mobility (from 14.1 to 33.5 cm2/Vs) and 20 times increase of self-gain (Av= gmro, the fully saturated drain current). Analysis with FDM simulation, I-V characteristics, and TEM observation strongly suggests that the significant enhancement in performance metrics originated from a decrease of Schottky barrier height between Ti/Au metal and the semiconducting MoS2. Picosecond laser annealing will be a promising technology to build up a high performance flexible MoS2 TFTs in analog / digital integrated circuitry.\n",

Among numerous techniques, nanoparticle-assisted lithography which employs catalytic nanoparticles to make trenches or holes in graphene has gathered a great amount of interests because this approach is comparatively milder than other top-down lithographic methods and greatly facile to generate nano-sized architectures in graphene. However, this nanoparticle approach suffers from the lack of morphological control because the place of nanoparticles onto graphene where the etching starts cannot be accurately controlled.The diblock copolymer approach has been used to synthesize arrayed nanoparticles on large-area substrates and is a potential candidate to prepare nanoparticles on graphene. Diblock copolymers which consist of two chemically distinct homopolymers linked by a covalent bond spontaneously assemble into periodic nanostructures, of which the size and morphology can be controlled by the molecular weight and composition of copolymers. In addition, diblock copolymer forms nano-sized micelles consisting of a soluble corona and an insoluble core in a selective solvent for one of the blocks of copolymers. The diblock copolymers micelles can be coated on solid substrates to generate a monolayered micellar thin film, which can serve as a nanotemplate to generate arrays of nanoparticles.In this work, we successfully fabricated large-area nanoperforated graphene having array of holes by ordered arrays of Pt nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were synthesized from a single-layered film of diblock copolymer micelles spin-coated onto graphene. The size and spacing of holes in graphene were effectively controlled in nanoscale by the molecular weight of copolymers.\n",

The sensing mechanism involves the transformations between different oxidation and doping forms of PANI. Upon exposure to Cu2+ aqueous solution, the sensors exhibit two significant reflectance intensity decreasing bands at 435 and 650 nm which induce the color changes from white to blue dramatically. This new sensor shows colorimetric response specifically to Cu2+ ions (white-to-blue color change) over other possible interfering metal cations and allows for detection of Cu2+ in aqueous solution with a low detection limit of 1 ppb observing by naked eye. Additionally, the colorimetric responses are visualized quantitative by using a color-differentiation map prepared form converted RGB (red, green and blue) values. Furthermore, the as-prepared PANI/PA-6 NFN sensor strips could successfully combine with the color map, which suggested a promising analytical method as an economical alternative to traditional Cu2+ sensors and also provided a new insight into the design and development of novel colorimetric sensing system based on the NFN platform.\n",

In this article we describe how different kinds of nanotubes can be produced with just one kind of nanoribbons. Here, we find the relationship between chirality of produce carbon nanotubes and width of zigzag nanoribbons. For achieving to this result, molecular dynamic simulation was used with LAMMPS package.  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different chirality have various electronic properties. This material can be metal, tiny band gap or large band gap semiconductor and it is related to chirality of nanotube.  CNTs can be produced by different methods. New method for producing carbon nanotubes by exact chirality from graphene nanoribbons is suggested here.  For achieving to this molecular dynamic simulation with LAMMPS package was used, and the potential that applied to the system was rebo semiclassical potential that brenner suggested for hydrocarbons .  At first we attached the H atoms to one of the sublatices of graphene in one side because the H atoms can not absorb to both sublattices in one side .This absorption cause of applied the force, that rolling-up graphenes to CNTs by changing hybridization of C atoms in one sablattices (that absorption H atom) from SP2 to SP3.  We defined the size of graphene naoribbons with the number of zigzag chain along the width. This simulation was done for size 4 to 16. During this experiment two kind of mechanism was identified that change in a critical width.  The first mechanism of rolling was happened by side by side attachment. For this mechanism the size of nanoribbons must be at least size 10. For even size the chirality of produce nanotube is (size/2, size/2) and for odd size is ((size+1)/2,(size-1)/2).  Other mechanism was happend for sizes less than 9 and rolling was happened with spiral motion here . Nanotubes with different chirality were produced in this mechanism and the radius of nanotubes is increased where the size of nanoribbons is decreased. The chirality of CNTs has relationship with size of graphene nanoribbons that go in a direction in select chirality chart.\n",

We investigate the development of ‘hybrid&’ nanomaterials by utilizing graphene-based systems coupled with transition metal oxides (e.g. nano-/micro- manganese oxides i.e. a-MnO2 [Mn(IV)] and a-Mn3O4 [Mn (II, III)]) which lays the groundwork for high-performance electrochemical electrodes for alternative energy owing to their higher specific capacitance, wide operational potential window and stability through charge-discharge cycling, environmentally benignity, cost-effective, easily processable and reproducible on a larger scale. To accomplish this, we strategically designed and synthesized by direct anchoring or physical adsorption of a-MnO2 and a-Mn3O4 on the variants of graphene namely, oxidized surface functional groups of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via mixing dispersions of the constituents under mild ultrasonication resulting in four different combinations. This facile approach affords strong chemical/ physical attachment and expected to have coupling between the pseudocapacitive transition metal oxides and supercapacitive nanocarbons leading to enhanced activity/reactivity and durability. We used a range of complementary analytical characterization tools to determine structure and physical properties such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) combined with elemental Raman mapping, and transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). All of these techniques reveal surface morphology, local (lattice dynamical) and average structure, and surface charge transfer due to the physically adsorbed manganese of synthesized hybrids that helps to establish microscopic structure-property-function correlations to further investigate their electrochemical supercapacitor properties.

A key characteristic of holographic displays is a viewing angle of the reconstruction images. The viewing angle depends on the pixel pitch of spatial light modulators (SLMs). We have developed magneto-optic 3D displays (3D-MOSLMs) with submicron scaled magnetic pixels to apply wide-viewing holographic display. The 3D-MOSLMs modulated light polarization with magneto-optic (MO) effect. The magnetic pixel array was fabricated on a-TbFe films by thermomagnetic driving. 3D images reconstructed from the magnetic pixel array. The viewing angle is 30 degrees. The brightness of reconstruction image depends on MO property of magnetic film. In this paper, we focused on mono-layer magnetic garnet films and magnetophotonic crystals (MPCs) composed of magnetic garnet as defect layer.The brightness of reconstruction image depends on the reference light intensity and optical efficiency eta;opt of magnetic films. The eta;opt was calculated with eta;opt = %T × eta;diff, where %T is transmissivity of magnetic films, eta;diff is diffraction efficiency that is defined as ratio between intensity of a transmitted light and a first order diffracted light. The transmissivity depends on thickness of magnetic films. The Faraday rotation is proportional to thickness of magnetic film. Therefore, the eta;diff has dependence of thickness. The MPC structure was (Ta2O5/SiO2)2/magnetic garnet/(SiO2/Ta2O5)2. The thickness of magnetic garnet layer was 1.0 mu;m. This structure was designed optical thickness to localize light at 532 nm. The magnetic garnet was used poly crystalline Bi1.3Dy0.85Y0.85Fe3.8Al1.2O12 (BiDyYFeAlG) films with perpendicular magnetization. Thickness of mono-layer BiDyYFeAlG films was 0.66 mu;m, 1.2 mu;m, 1.9 mu;m and 3.7 mu;m were fabricated. For comparison, the theoretical eta;opt for simple magnetic grating for MPC and mono-layer BiDyYFeAlG films was calculated by finite element simulation, while changing thickness of BiDyYFeAlG layer for MPC and mono-layer film.The diffraction efficiency of magnetic films was measured with a two beam interferometer, while changing energy density of laser light for thermomagnetic recording. The highest eta;opt of mono-layer BiDyYFeAlG was 1.8×10-2 % at 1.9 mu;m thickness. However, simulated theoretical eta;opt of mono-layer BiDyYFeAlG film has peak at 3.8 mu;m thickness. The reason of this difference was thermal diffusion in the thermomagnetic recording. These results mean that there is a limit to the thickness for thermomagnetic recording. The MPC with a thin defect layer could be obtained MO property corresponding to the large thickness film. The theoretical eta;opt of MPC has peak at about 1.0 mu;m defect layer. The thickness was enough for thermomagnetic recording. As a result, the eta;opt of MPC was 2.1×10-2 %. The brightness of reconstruction image of MPC that was calculated by eta;opt and reference beam power (lambda; = 532 nm, 8.6 mW/cm2) was 101 cd/m2.\n",

The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond (NV) has an electronic spin state with long coherence times that can be optically initialized, manipulated, and measured - unique properties that allow the NV to act as an optically accessible solid-state qubit. Unfortunately, the scalability of quantum networks fabricated entirely in diamond is limited due to the stochastic nature of NV placement and the difficulty of large-scale high-quality diamond patterning. In contrast, silicon nitride (SiN) based photonics is a mature field allowing for the fabrication of complex photonic circuits. Here we present a scalable method for the bottom-up fabrication of a hybrid photonic circuit combining the superior quantum properties of single NVs with the mature fabrication of SiN photonic elements. Using transfer-mask nanolithography developed by our group, we fabricated arrays of single-mode micro-waveguides from diamond membranes with a low density of naturally occurring NVs. These micro-waveguides were optically characterized with a confocal setup. We selected individual diamond micro-waveguides with optimal NV placement and deterministically placed them over air gaps in single-mode SiN waveguides. Simulations indicate that with an adiabatic-like transition between the diamond and SiN waveguide modes, up to 82% of the photons emitted from the NV can be collected into the single mode SiN waveguide. This high collection is crucial for high fidelity spin measurements and network scalability. We demonstrate efficient coupling of fluorescence from a single NV into a single-mode SiN photonic circuit with a rate of more than 1.4 million photons collected into a single direction of a single-mode SiN waveguide at saturation. The single-photon statistics of signal collected through the waveguide are preserved below saturation with antibunching of photon arrivals below 0.5. Moreover, the NV electron spin coherence time is measured to be comparable to previous bulk measurements, indicating that our nano-fabrication technique and device assembly do not degrade the nuclear and electronic environments around the NV centers. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the high-yield integration of diamond micro-waveguides containing NV centers with high-quality spectral and spin properties into SiN photonic circuitry. Scaling to multiple, high-quality quantum bits integrated into a complex photonic circuit is made possible by pre-screening arrays of diamond micro-waveguides for optimal coupling of fluorescence. This provides a scalable architecture for the creation of a complex photonic circuit for quantum information processing.\n",

Patel 1   2  Noel  Wan 1  Luozhou  Li 1  Tim  Schroeder 1  Sara L. Mouradian 1  Edward H. Chen 1  Dirk R. Englund 1  1MIT Cambridge USA2Stanford Stanford USAShow AbstractQuantum repeaters require efficient interfaces between photons in optical fibers and quantum memories. There has been particular interest in quantum memories based on spin states in the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) defect center in diamond. Here we demonstrate the integration of diamond micro-waveguides containing individual NV- centers directly with silica optical fibers. Our micro-waveguides are single-mode, and are fabricated from single crystal diamond with a rectangular shape of 200 nm x 200 nm x 10 mu;m. We fabricate adiabatically tapered fibers with a diameter of approximately 500 nm to couple light efficiently to and from these diamond waveguides. A single micro-waveguide is selected, based on its optical properties, and subsequently placed directly on the tapered region using a nanomanipulator. Finite-difference-time-domain simulations suggest efficient energy transfer from the NV- center into the micro-waveguide and finally the tapered fiber. This coupling efficiency is substantially higher than previous fiber-integrated systems that rely on coupling to point emitters such as nanodiamonds and colloidal quantum dots. In our experiments, we observe a raw single photon count rate of (712.3 ± 23.6) x 103 sec-1 at saturation pump power from two fiber ends combined, prior to correcting for system inefficiencies. Strong photon anti-bunching is observed in both auto- and cross-correlation measurements. We also present preliminary data on spin manipulation using optically detected magnetic resonance of the NV- electron spin. The demonstrated experimental system can find applications as a robust room-temperature single photon source and as a fiber-integrated quantum memory for quantum information networks.\n",

Al2O3/Si3N4/SiO2 stacks having thicknesses of 15/6.5/3.5 nm were fabricated on p-type silicon substrates. The Al2O3 layer was formed by atomic layer deposition using H2O/TMA at 300 oC. Post deposition annealing (PDA) of the samples was performed at 850 or 1050 oC using two different PDA processes: (1) furnace annealing (FA) for 15 min and (2) rapid thermal annealing (RTA) for 1 or 5 min. Pt-gate MANOS capacitors were fabricated by photolithography and lift-off process. The capacitance equivalent thickness, as extracted from Capacitance-Voltage characteristics strongly depends upon the PDA process being smaller for the FA samples. The current density-tunnel oxide electric field (J-E) characteristics of the unannealed samples, in the negative bias regime, are dominated by gate electron injection effects. Temperature dependent current-voltage characteristics within the temperature range of 100-380K show negligible thermal activation. This type of conduction is attributed to trap assisted tunneling via defect bands within the Al2O3. On the contrary, the FA samples exhibit significantly reduced currents with a dominant conduction mechanism arising from substrate hole direct tunneling for tunnel oxide fields within the range of 8-13 MV/cm and hole FN injection for fields above 13 MV/cm. The RTA processed samples exhibit, in the negative gate voltage regime, a conduction behavior where both electron injection from the gate and hole injection from the substrate coexist. Incremental step pulse programing using either positive or negative pulses measurements supports the above findings; only the furnace processed samples exhibit significant hole trapping effect with ΔVFB~-5V. Erase performance measurements revealed that the FA samples have the fastest erase transitions from the write state. The above indicate that the PDA thermal budget has a profound influence on the defect bands via which Al2O3 electron transport takes place. Our study reveals that PDA at a temperature as small as 850 oC for 15 min is capable to eliminate a significant portion of the defect states and thus to greatly improve the erase performance of MANOS memory stacks.\n",

Conventionally, a selection device such as diode or transistor is integrated in order to avoid cross-talk interference between adjacent cells which in turn increases area consumption as well as complexity in the fabrication process considerably. Here, a novel architecture based on the vertical structure of Metal-Dielectric-Graphene-Insulator-Metal (MDGIM) is proposed to realize the functionality of one transistor-one resistor (1T-1R) architecture while maintaining the high-density 4F2 footprint. Transistor functionality is vertically integrated into the RRAM device by exploiting the workfunction tunability of graphene via external gate field to modulate the current flow across the memory cell. In this structure, Metal-Dielectric-Graphene (MDG) stack collectively functions as workfunction-tunable bottom electrode for Graphene-Insulator-Metal (GIM) RRAM device.A proof-of concept MDGIM device is demonstrated based on the stack of ITO/ Al2O3/Graphene/ Aluminum tris (8-hydroxyquinolate) (Alq3)/Al. MDG stack is first prepared by transferring CVD grown monolayer graphene on 20 nm-thick Al2O3 film deposited on the pre-patterned ITO gate electrode on the glass substrate. MDGIM device is then completed by thermal deposition of Alq3 and Al top metal electrode via shadow mask. MDGIM device shows an electrical nonvolatile memory behavior including Vth of sim; 5 V, Vw (write) of sim; 6.5 V, and Ve (erase) of ~8 V. The Ion/Ioff ratio is ~ 105 at Vr (read) of 3 V. This is comparable to the electrical characteristics exhibited by typical MIM device based-on ITO/Alq3/Al structure. The transistor functionality of the MDGIM device is evaluated by measuring the drain current versus gate voltage (ID-VG) at both low resistance state (LRS) and high resistance state (HRS). In the LRS condition, the current at a fixed bias of 3V (Vr) can be modulated by ~10 over the gate bias range of ± 8 V. When the device is turned to HRS, the current flow across the device is extremely low (~1 nA at 3V) and hence no significant gate modulation is observed.In contrast to conventional 1T-1R architecture, our proposed MDGIM structure not only has an ability to retain high-density cross-point arrays but also enables a simple implementation opening up new strategy to make low-temperature and low-cost flexible memory devices.\n",

However faster set/reset at lower voltages/current as well as improved reliability, retention and variability are highly desirable characteristics which have motivated the further exploration of various techniques like composition modification by adding elements like Al [2][3]. However, only 1-2 samples (compositions) have been compared to show promising behaviour. This motivates a more detailed exploration of the HfxAl1-xOy system. The conventional sputtering techniques enable the evaluation of a few selected compositions in the wide composition space of HfxAl1-xOy. In this work, we propose the use of combinatorial sputtering for high-throughput materials screening for RRAM applications and use the ternary system of HfxAl1-xOy as a model system.We use the combinatorial sputter technique to simultaneously sputter HfO2 and Al2O3 targets to obtain a film of HfxAl1-xOy with continuous composition gradient on a single wafer surface. The value of ‘x&’ varies from 0 to 1 for our experiments. First, we present a systematic study of dependence of material parameters like bandgap, refractive index, dielectric constant, conduction band and valence band offset etc. on the composition of HfxAl1-xOy. The well-characterized material is then used to study the effect of composition of HfxAl1-xOy on RRAM devices. The effect of oxide thickness scaling as well as electrodes material is also studied. As a baseline, individual pure oxides, HfO2 and Al2O3, are used. The Al2O3 based RRAM devices are found to have larger memory window and lower current levels as compared to HfO2 based RRAM devices. The role of composition, then, in controlling/altering the switching parameters like forming voltage, set/reset voltages and currents etc. and obtaining the optimum parameters for resistive switching is explored. Finally, the memory performance parameters i.e. resistance ratio, endurance, speed, retention, are used to further understand the effect of composition of HfxAl1-xOy on RRAM devices. Thus, a comprehensive study of effect of composition of HfxAl1-xOy on RRAM devices in presented. Such a high-throughput materials screening method .provides both excellent composition resolution and efficiency which is highly desirable for the exploration of ternary oxide systems which have a broad composition space.References -[1] Y.

Applications ranging from biomedical to consumer electronics impose some specifications to be met in this new electronics generation, such as high flexibility, reliability, performance, and integration density. Great progress and milestones have already been achieved through different approaches utilizing polymeric substrates and polymeric devices. However, there are many challenges along the way. This is expected with the attempt to replace the well-established semiconductor industry processes, and material systems with low-cost processes (garage fabrication). Other approaches exist, such as utilizing expensive silicon on insulator (SOI) or unorthodox silicon (111) wafers and peeling off the thin silicon nano-ribbons with or without devices. This solves the thermal budget limitations partially and low performance associated with organic electronics but at the expense of the higher costs and limited integration density. To this end, we provide a pragmatic approach to complement current research which transforms bulk silicon into a flexible fabric hosting devices. Our approach follows an etch-protect-release-recycle process to peel off an ultra-thin flexible sheet with pre-fabricated devices from low cost bulk mono-crystalline Si (100), commonly used in industry. This process capitalizes on the semiconductor industry as opposed to replacing it and eliminates the higher costs. Furthermore, we utilize our demonstrated process to build up various device components required for building flexible memory modules, essential elements in all electronic systems. This is a necessary step towards taking flexible electronics research into demonstration of completely flexible stand-alone electronics systems. In this work, we discusses our generic transformative process for creating flexible Si fabrics with various demonstrated devices required for building a flexible memory module. We also report fabrication and characterization of all necessary elements required for silicon based fully flexible memory module. Devices include DRAM cells (MIMCAPs), NVM cells (ReRAM and FeRAM), and select transistors (MOSCAPs to study the gate stack) to be used in crossbars arrays architectures, all built on thin flexible silicon fabric. This is an important step forward towards achieving completely flexible stand-alone electronic modules while capitalizing on the perks associated with the well-established silicon based semiconductor industry. Finally, we discuss the limitations imposed on these memory modules on flexible silicon platform in terms of frequency limitations for MOSCAPs and MIMCAPs, mechanical limitations and performance variations for NVM cells, and reliability aspects related to flexible platform and the associated process&’s effect on device performance.\n",

As domain walls can be created, displaced and annihilated under applied electric fields, much excitement comes from the possibility that they could provide changeable, compliant pathways that can be modified during device operation; a key element in the emerging field of adaptive electronics. While the investigations of properties of individual domain walls is intensifying, the ‘next essential step&’, namely control of their movement, one of their most highly prized features, is entirely missing. In the present work we demonstrate an ability to nucleate, move and control domain walls, over long distances in PbZr0.1Ti0.9O3 thin films. Domains can be nucleated locally on the nanoscale and the associated domain walls can be subsequently propagated on the scale of several microns without the need for moving parts such as a PFM probe tip. This domain wall propagation can be easily controlled via selection of the appropriate voltage pulse duration and magnitude. In fact these domain walls can be positioned, reset and re-positioned many times with a high degree of precision while the manipulation of several domain walls at once is demonstrated, all from simple appropriate biasing of the top electrode within the thin film architecture. Instrumental in this implementation of domain wall control is the unique properties of the thin Pt top electrode (~10 nm) deposited by electron-beam induced breakdown of a precursor gas. Additionally we are able to accurately describe the system by analogy to the classical Stefan problem [5] which has previously been used to describe many diverse systems but is here applied to electric circuits for the first time.[1] Seidel, J. et al.

High response coefficients and an enhanced width of the high response regime around the \"ordering temperature\", Tm, make relaxors popular systems for applications as piezoelectric/electrostrictive actuators and sensors [1].The idealized structure of SBN, with the generalized formula A2B4C4Nb2Nb8O30 [2], has three types of structural channels along the c axis, formed by two types of crystallographically independent NbO6 octahedra. Disorder due to presence of voids in A cation sites (occupied by Sr atoms) and random distribution of Ba and Sr in B cation sites are thought to be responsible for the relaxor behavior, via the formation of random electric fields and, subsequently, polar nanodomains oriented in the only easy polarization axis c, without a structural change occurring in the phase transition. In this work we present structural and chemical studies of a SBN single crystal by means of Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) and High Angular Annular Dark Field (HAADF) along the [001] and [100] zone axes.HAADF imaging in the [100] zone axis directly showed the presence of randomly distributed vacancies in the A cation position. SAED diffraction patterns showed the main reflections expected for the TTB structure and also additional superstructure spots due to a modulation of the structure. This modulation was found to be incommensurate, since the additional spots did not show equal separation in the superstructure planes. The presence of streaks along the [010] direction is also consistent with the expected lattice strains due to the presence of A site vacancies.HAADF imaging along the [001] zone axis yielded structural information consistent with this modulation. Elongation of spots corresponding to B site cation columns (projection of displaced atomic positions) is in good agreement with previous works on XRD structure refinement on this system, where the modulation was attributed to displacement of atoms (Sr/Ba) occupying this B site.In order to gain further insight into this modulation, Annular Bright Field (ABF) imaging experiments are planned. The sensitivity of this imaging technique to contrast arising from lighter atoms should allow obtaining a map of oxygen coordination in the structure along the [001] zone axis, which could be affected by the heavier B site atoms displacements. In order to check the remaining factor expected to give rise to the relaxor behavior, Sr/Ba random distribution in B cation position, EELS chemical mapping is also planned in both [001] and [100] zone axes.References[1]The relaxor-enigma - charge disorder and random fields in ferroelectrics, W.

Maximilian  Fleischer 1  Roland  Pohle 1  Kerstin  Wiesner 1  Oliver  von Sicard 1  Polina  Davydovskaya 1  Stefan  Stegmeier 1  Karen  Fuchs 1  1Siemens AG Munich GermanyShow AbstractSolid state chemical sensors, often in a MEMS approach, became a mature technology and create product innovations in building, medical, automotive, consumer and industrial technologies. The key feature of each chemical sensor is the sensitive layer that undergoes a reversible interaction e.g. with gas species to be detected. The result is finally translated into an electrical output signal. Metal oxides, due to their chemical robustness and longevity are very frequently used as sensitive layers at few 100 °C. However, since surface reactions occur with a large variety of gases, these sensors respond similar to various gases with similar chemical reactivity. Certain applications, like measuring the overall amount of smell in room air are demanding this. Applications like the detection of explosive natural gas / toxic CO or breath ethanol require one gas to be selectively detected. Applications like the recognition of fire related gas patterns or the smell pattern in human breath for medical diagnosis require a differentiated detection of quite complex gas patterns.Surface engineering, for a long time, has been the answer of tailoring the gas reactivity of metal oxide surfaces to the needs of the application, keeping the oxides surfaces at a constant temperature. Options are the choice of the preferred chemical reaction at a stable oxide surface by usage of the proper temperature, the application of catalytic filters that oxidize interfering gases before they reach the surface and coating the surface with material that add the desired chemical reactivity - these may be other oxides, but a lot of catalytically active noble materials showed nice results here. Nanosized materials have been successfully used to improve the benefits. The research on these materials however recently revealed, that pre-adsorbed species from former measurements play an increasingly important role here. One example is the intermitted usage of higher temperatures, temporarily creating activated oxygen species that then convey nice gas reactions even at room temperature.This leads to a recent paradigm change, the trend here is called transient operation of metal oxides, usually performed by rapid changes of the operation temperature. This technique distinctly employs non equilibrium conditions of the surface and plays with adsorption/desorption time constants in the range of 0.1-10s by changing temperatures with a similar rate. This is made feasible by sensor constructions where with oxides placed on temperature cycled membrane structures. The sensor signal is monitored as a function of time and multivariate approaches or functional data analysis is employed to reveal the chemical information. It is astonishing to see which differentiated analysis of multi-component gas mixtures can be obtained with a single oxidic surface, employable e.g. to distinguish between the smells of different fire states or to distinguish between the smells of different human activities.\n",

Sturm 1  Sigurd  Wagner 1  1Princeton University Princeton USAShow AbstractWe have measured and simulated the unity power gain fmax of ZnO thin-film transistors (TFTs) in order to design transistor oscillators that will robustly operate above ft. These TFTs are to be integrated into hybrid systems combining large-area electronics and CMOS ICs. Previously demonstrated systems based on a-Si TFTs and CMOS have enabled applications in energy harvesting, wireless sensing, and communication [1]. MHz-frequency oscillators based on resonant circuit topologies are key components in such systems because they permit operation at frequencies above the ft of low-mobility a-Si TFTs. Transistor oscillators can operate above ft so long as the transistors can provide power gain that is greater than unity, i.e., before the fmax frequency is reached. Hence, transistor fmax is a critical performance metric that must be evaluated to determine the high-frequency potential of a TFT technology.Our TFTs are based on plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) ZnO [2], and have mobilities >10cm2/Vs, Vth = 3V, and <200mV/decade subthreshold slope. TFTs on glass substrates employ a 100nm thick Cr gate metal, 32nm PEALD Al2O3 gate dielectric, 10nm PEALD ZnO active layer, 28nm PEALD Al2O3 back-channel passivation, and 100nm Ti/150nm Au source and drain metal. Fmax was extracted directly from the 0dB crossing of the maximum available gain, which was determined from S-parameter measurements. Fabricated devices with W/L ratios of 600um/30um and gate-source/drain overlaps Xov = 15um yield fmax values of 930kHz, in excellent agreement with predictive models we developed with extracted device parameters.There are several parasitic factors that limit fmax. Analytically, fmax = ft/radic;((2π*ft*Cgd*Rg) + Rg/ro), where Cgd ~ W*(L+2*Xov), Rg is the gate resistance, and ro is the output resistance. Because our ZnO TFTs have ro values >100kohms, the Cgd*Rg term becomes the dominant parasitic to minimize to boost fmax. To address the high Cgd resulting from 15um overlaps, we developed a self-aligned process that reduces Xov to 0.7um [3]. To reduce high Rg values (~3kohm) in our TFTs, we replaced the 100nm thick Cr gate metal with a 30nm Cr/ 50nm Al/ 20nm Cr stack. Self-aligned devices with W/L = 600um/30um and Rg = 700ohms have measured fmax values of 5MHz, a dramatic 5X improvement over our Cr gate, non-self aligned devices. In a further effort to reduce Cgd, shorter-channel (400um/20um) self-aligned devices with Rg = 925ohms were made, which exhibit fmax values of 6.8MHz, an additional improvement.Fmax can be further improved by shrinking the channel length and reducing Rg with higher conductivity metals, thicker gates, and/or multifinger layouts. Oscillator work is also ongoing--to date, PEALD ZnO TFTs have yielded LC oscillators that operate >3MHz.[1] Y. Hu et al., VLSI Symp., June 2013 [2] T. Moy et al, DRC, June 2014. [3] D. A.

Integration of transition metal oxides as interface layers has enhanced both device stability and performance compared to their organic and/or inorganic counterparts. This, combined with their compatibility with large-area depositing techniques, motivates their integration in OPVs. Here, we propose the stability assessment of MoO3 in inverted and packaged polythiophene:fullerene cells with Ag/Al composite electrode in operational conditions combining solar radiation and 65°C. The Ag/Al electrode balances the enhanced air stability, owing to the combined metal thickness of 300 nm, with low-cost material selection. In the over 1000 h ageing study the performance loss of over 50% in the first 200 h is dominated by a drop in the short-circuit current (Jsc). We reveal a concurrent loss in reflectance from 85% to 40% below 1.9 eV, which is below the optical gap of the used photo-active materials, hence excluding any major degradation in the bulk of this layer. Correlating the responses of aged devices to a series of test structures comprised of the bottom ITO/ZnO cathode, the top MoO3/Ag or MoO3/Ag/Al anode and their combinations with the active layer allowed us to identify that the combination of Ag and Al reproduces the low reflectance of aged devices. This suggests that Al plays a critical role in the failure independent of the photo-active layer. Systematic single-stress ageing further indicates that elevated heat solely triggers this mechanism. Cross-section transmission electron microscope coupled with elemental analysis revealed the unsuspected role of Al, notably it diffuses through the entire 150 nm thick Ag layer and accumulates at the MoO3/Ag interface. Depth profiling with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy advanced our understanding by indicating the oxidation of Al only at the MoO3/Ag interface hinting that MoO3 is the source of oxygen and is most probably reduced. Control X-ray diffraction measurement, not relying on sputtering, allowed us to confirm the diffusion of Al and exclude any contribution from metal induced crystallization in MoO3. Finally, the input from the material characterization to optical simulations allowed to reproduce the reflectance response of aged devices and estimated that 20% of the loss in Jsc is ascribed to optical changes in MoO3. Concurrent shift in its energy levels could account for the remaining performance loss as well as other failure mechanisms might also contribute. In conclusion, our root-cause failure analysis provides insight into the harmful interaction of two non-adjacent layers and their consequently changed optical properties resulting in overall electrical performance loss. This insight provides guidelines for heat-stable MoO3/metal contacts, independent of the active layer and illustrates the much needed but still rare root-cause failure analysis in OPVs.\n",

Two examples of molecular n-dopants are the dimethylbenzimidazolium salts (DMBI-X), which release unidentified reactive intermediates during a thermal deposition process, and the 1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazoles (DMBI-H) which dope by hydride transfer. In either case, additional carriers result from the same benzimidazolium cation/host radical anion pair, DMBI+/Abull;-, reaction product. For DMBI-I dopants, strong n-doping has only been observed for vacuum deposited films, and for DMBI-H dopants, the necessary hydride transfer step will limit the scope of dopable host materials. Here we report on the synthesis, characterization, and doping mechanism of benzimidazoline-radical dimers ((DMBI)2) and their use to form the doped state DMBI+/Abull;- in conjugated polymers. The distinct properties of the (DMBI)2 dopants relative to the DMBI-H dopants is evident from the reaction rate, polaron intensities, Fermi level shifts, and conductivities achieved using (2-Cyc-DMBI)2 and 2-Cyc-DMBI-H. The distinct reactions by which the dopants function results in greater variability of the doping effect for the DMBI-H compound than for the dimer in the hosts explored in this study. The present work demonstrates the importance of mechanistic understanding for achieving effective doping, and will advance the field by providing clear methodology for the preparation and utilization of potent (DMBI)2 dopants.\n",

Despite their semicrystalline nature, thienothiophene (TT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based copolymers have recently shown exceptional charge carrier mobilities due to their rigid conjugated backbones that allow a relatively high amount of ordering in the solid state. While the crystallinity of a polymer is known to depend strongly on its molecular weight (MW), typical polymers made with TT of DPP monomers have polydispersity indexes (PDIs) around 2.0, indicating that chains with significantly different lengths are present. Herein, by precisely selecting polymer chain lengths (through preparative size exclusion chromatography) characterizing the resulting thin film microstructure (by AFM, Synchrotron GIXS), and measuring the electronic properties via TFTs, we describe new insights into the relationship between chain ordering and charge transport.1 Specifically, the roles of side chain and backbone crystallization and chain entanglement are examined. We further show it is possible to drastically improve the mobility in poorly performing films prepared from low MW polymers by adding only small amounts of high MW material, suggesting that long chains strongly affect the intermolecular charge transport at grain boundaries by electronically bridging crystalline aggregates. The factors of molecular weight and PDI are accordingly found to affect morphology and performance of BHJ OPVs made with C60 derivatives. Indeed by optimizing MW and processing conditions we succeeded in increasing the PCE for PBTTT-C14:PCBM devices by a factor of 2 over the previous state-of-the-art. Finally, in an effort to unravel the roles of inter- and intra-chain transport on the overall mobility we present a prototype polymer made of short, low PDI and fully conjugated segments linked by flexible aliphatic chains. Our flexibly-linked (FL) material exhibited improved thin-film formation compared to the low MW starting polymer and unique thermal properties which were exploited to demonstrate the evolution between distinct thin film morphologies without altering the chain length. Subsequent electronic characterization of the thin films revealed unexpected differences between the charge carrier transport and allowed a relative assessment of the roles of inter- and intra-molecular charge transport in the film.2 Overall we show how our bottom-up approach to control crystallinity of both photovoltaic and transistor devices affords deep insights and directs the design of the next generation polymers.1.

This is of particular importance in the case of recently developed polymer semiconductors showing charge mobility in excess of 1 and 10 cm2/Vs for electrons and holes, respectively, which forces to critically reconsider part of previous assumptions on charge transport in polymer films. In this context, while pure microstructural investigations, such as those based on X-rays, electron microscopy, or polarized optical probes, provide necessary information for the rationalization of transport in macromolecular solids, a general model predicting how charge accommodates within structural maps is not yet available. Therefore, techniques capable of directly monitoring how charge is distributed when injected into a polymer film and how it correlates with structural domains can help fill this gap. With the support of density functional theory calculations, we show that polarized charge modulation microscopy (p-CMM)1,2 can unambiguously and selectively map the orientational order of the only conjugated segments that are probed by mobile charge in the few nanometer thick accumulation layer of a high-mobility polymer-based field-effect transistor. In particular we test this technique on different polymer films where the microstructure and charge mobility is controlled by the amount of pre-aggregation of chains in the solution.3 Depending on the specific solvent-induced microstructure, p-CMM can image charge-probed domains that extend from submicrometer to tens of micrometers size, with markedly different degrees of alignment. Wider and more ordered p-CMM domains are associated with improved carrier mobility. This observation evidences the unprecedented opportunity to correlate, directly in a working device, electronic properties with structural information on those conjugated segments involved in charge transport at the buried semiconductor-dielectric interface of a field-effect device. Moreover these findings help to underline the critical role of film interconnectivity and long-range orientational ordering on the transport properties of a polymer where transport involves highly localizes, intra-molecular polaronic species.4[1] C.

With record power conversion efficiencies approaching 10 % for laboratory devices, efficiency of OPVs still lag behind other technologies such as Silicon-based photovoltaics that can provide 15 % in module. However, the benefits of OPV rely on the possibility to produce flexible and low weight products with a high degree of design freedom. In addition, it has been claimed that OPV can overperform silicon technology under low light conditions. However, this statement has not yet been proved as a general principle. These advantages and the ease of handling in subsequent product-integration processes will enable the development of consumer and portable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) products. A value-added application in BIPV is the production of semitransparent windows that permit both natural illumination of a room and production of solar electricity. In this regard a search for semitransparent top electrodes has recently proved: a fruitful range of materials can now be used.Proper bulk heterojunction morphology in polymer-fullerene solar cells is a significant condition for the efficient photogenerated exciton separation, however with a random distribution of donor and acceptor in the active layer charge carriers can be trapped causing efficiency decreasing. One of the solutions is the controlled vertical phase-segregation, where electron selective fullerene is predominantly covering the cathode in a consequence of determined device treatment. Different techniques, such as: X-ray diffraction, variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, transmission electron microscopy etc. have been developed to study segregation of donor and acceptor molecules within the active layer. However, abovementioned techniques are complementary and each presents its own limitations that make them inaccessible to many research labs.Here we present a direct method to use EQE measurement to observe the donor/acceptor concentration at a given interface by measuring its individual contribution towards the photocurrent. The technique relies on the differential penetration of the light depending on the wavelength. Importantly, we are able to discern the cases in which having a high concentration of donor or acceptor at the incorrect contact (selective to the opposite carrier) have an impact on the device performance. Moreover, using the impedance spectroscopy, we explained the importance of vertical segregation in the semitransparent bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells espessially at low light intensities, which his particularly important for the indoor applications.\n",

Success demands a transition to higher capacity electrodes, for which metal anodes will be required to achieve significant gains. The multivalent alkaline earth metals are attractive anodes from the perspective of energy density when combined with a high voltage cathode and a stable, functional electrolyte. High Coulombic efficiency is difficult to achieve with Mg, typically with a chloro-Mg complex in an ether solvent, and unreported for Ca. Chloride electrolytes are not suitable for envisioned high voltage oxide-based insertion cathodes. Additionally, an optimized Mg cell will require near unit Coulombic efficiency for Mg cycling onto itself over a wide range of deposition and stripping rates to suit the storage application.Our goal is to understand how the Mg cation source and the solvent contribute to high Coulombic efficiency, morphologically controlled deposition and stripping. Electrochemical AFM/STM is employed to explore how Mg layer growth onto and dissolution from Mg occurs using inorganic sources of chloro-Mg complexes or weakly associated Mg salts in aprotic solvents. Chloro-Mg complexes result in highly textured Mg films that grow and dissolute by classical diffusive metal atom flux to and from step edges. Disruption of the growth or dissolution process with periods of electrolyte equilibration (static state of a battery anode) results in surface film formation. This film impedes both arriving and departing metal flux to the point that deposition and dissolution are re-initiated as localized processes, leading to the evolution of complex morphologies with cycling. The consequence of surface film induced defect structure on morphological evolution is tracked using electrochemical TEM providing information of growth dynamics. The net result is that electrochemical access to the metal itself can become compromised and lead to capacity loss for an initially optimized cell. Simple Mg salts capable of Mg deposition exhibit more complex behavior and provide insight on the differences between protective chloride versus alternate anions. Select alternate anion combinations are employed to explore structure-activity relationships over the range of minimally impeded to blocking layer formation, where ionic conductivity is eliminated in the latter case. We hypothesize that understanding how such films form and function will help establish the design rules necessary to create stable and active alkaline earth metal anodes.This work is supported as part of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science.

Li 1  1Tsinghua University Beijing ChinaShow AbstractGood thermoelectric materials must have high Seebeck coefficient, good electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity, but it is very difficult to control these three parameters independently. Creating nanostructured composites is an effective approach to enhance the thermoelectric performance. There are mainly two kinds of composite structures, which are formed by annealing or mixing, respectively. The mixed composites with exteriorly embedded nanoscale dispersions are expected to possess higher thermal stability than annealing-processed composites, in which nanoscopic precipitates may grow or coalesce when used at high temperature. However, it is of importance to select the dispersed nanoparticles for different thermoelectric matrix. We studied the effect of SiC nanodispersion on Bi2Te3-based and PbTe-based thermoelectric materials. It was found that mixing SiC nanoparticles into the BiSbTe matrix is effective for its performance enhancement; a high dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) value up to 1.33 at 373 K is obtained in Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 dispersed with only 0.4vol% SiC nanoparticles. Mixing SiC nanoparticles in AgPbmSbTem+2 alloys also can lead to a ZT enhancement, but its mechanism is different from the case of BiSbTe alloys. Nevertheless, for both materials, SiC-dispersion could improve their mechanical property. In particular, SiC-whiskers can significantly improve the thermal stability of AgPbmSbTem+2 alloys at high temperatures.\n",

Myung 2  Jae-Hong  Lim 1  1Korea Institute of Materials Science Gyeongnam Korea (the Republic of)2UC Riverside Riverside USA3Korea Institute of Ceramic Engineering amp; Technology Seoul Korea (the Republic of)Show AbstractThermoelectric (TE) materials exhibit numerous interesting features such as solid-state operation, zero-emissions, vast scalability, low maintenance, and a long operating lifetime. However, its low efficiency, expressed as a dimensionless figure of merit, zT, limits many applications. Recent research into low-dimensional nanoengineered TE has identified classical and quantum mechanical size effects on electrons and phonons, which provide additional mechanisms to tune the ZT. Recent reports on the high peak zT of PbTe from 1.5 to 2.2 have raised interest in the material as thermoelectric applications. PbSe, compared with PbTe, has not been as frequently investigated for thermoelectrics due to its higher thermal conductivity and narrower bandgap. However, recent calculation and experiments from Parker, Singh, and Snyder showed the possibile application of of heavily doped PbSe in highly efficient thermoelectrics. In this report, we fabricated electrodeposited PbTe and PbSe nanowires patterned with photolithography, a method widely known as lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition. Nanowires fabricated in this manner do not need to be dispersed and aligned for measurements. Yang and Penner fabricated PbTe nanowires in this way, but they synthesized PbTe by cyclic electrodeposition-stripping. They electrodeposited PbTe and elemental lead simultaneously, and the excess lead was etched selectively. We synthesized few atomic layers of Pb and Te (Se) layer by layer using surface limited reactions, generally called as underpotential deposition (UPD). UPD is a phenomenon where few atomic layers of element are electrodeposited at a potential before the required potential for bulk deposits. Because underpotentially deposited Pb and Te(Se) have few atomic layers, a compound is formed spontaneously without annealing process. Thermoelectric properties of fabricated nanowires were measured and analyzed. Details will be presented.\n",

Nanoscale Cu-rich precipitate induced or enhanced by neutron irradiation is one of the main origins for embrittlement of RPV steels. Therefore, a detailed understanding of Cu precipitation kinetics is necessary to predict the embrittlement of RPV steels. Thereby, accurate estimation of the diffusivity and solubility limit of Cu is very important.However, such traditional studies to estimate the basic quantities performed mainly more than 30 years ago, only at much higher temperatures (ge;690°C) than those practically used (~300°C) because of the limited spatial resolutions. Temperatures in excess of the Curie temperature, which is about 760 °C for Fe, cause a paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition, which cause anomaly in the diffusivity at the transition temperature. Thus, the diffusivity for ferromagnetic Fe and steels at lower temperatures can only be obtained by extrapolation of data acquired in a very limited temperature range from about 690 to 760 °C, or by computer simulation, and more reliable values are strongly required.In this study, the diffusivity and solubility limit of copper in ferromagnetic iron and an A533B steel were directly measured at lower temperatures (ge;550°C) than in previous studies using a state-of-the-art technique, atom probe tomography (APT). In pure Fe, the diffusivity was determined to be D=0.48 exp(-Qfrasl;(kB T)) [m2frasl;s] (Q = 3.22 eV), which is, below 650°C, about 1.3 times higher than the extrapolation from previous study considering the magnetic effect. The measured Cu solubility limit was in good agreement with literature. In an A533B steel, for all annealing temperatures, the diffusivity of Cu in A533B steel were found to be 2-3 times higher than that in pure Fe, although the solubility limit of Cu was similar. APT was also used to study the grain boundary (GB) segregation and diffusion. No Cu segregation is observed at GB near the Cu/A533B steel interface.\n",

McCloy 1  1Washington State University Pullman USAShow AbstractThe Hanford site in southeastern Washington State is the largest repository of nuclear waste in the United States, where 177 underground tanks stored in excess of 50 million gallons of waste. This waste will be mixed with glass-forming additives and vitrified at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). A large fraction of the anticipated waste streams are simultaneously high in both Na and Al, leading to frequency crystallization of aluminosilicate phases such as nepheline upon cooling. This aluminosilicate crystallization has been previously shown to be deleterious to chemical durability due to the extraction of alumina and silica from the glass-forming matrix, leaving a residual glass of less durable components. The long-term corrosion resistance is of significance because vitrified waste must tolerate subterranean storage for ge;106 years.A challenge in the formulation of nuclear waste glasses arises from maintaining a sufficiently low addition of glass-forming additives to maximize waste loading, while ensuring that the addition is sufficiently high to prevent crystallization. In this study a glass composition, designated as A4, was selected due to its particular crystallization behavior. This composition was formulated for a high-alumina waste stream (>25 wt% Al2O3) with 45 wt% waste loading. A4 glass was batched from powder precursors and subjected to air quenching, isothermal heat treatments, and canister-centerline cooling (CCC) to observe the crystallization behavior, with the goal of obtaining time-temperature-transformation curves.Crystal fractions were obtained by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and crystallite structure was observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with composition measured through wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Nepheline, a feldspathoid with sodium end-member composition NaAlSiO4, is the prominent aluminosilicate phase in the CCC high-alumina waste glass, but it forms in unusually large isolated dendritic crystals in the presence of a complex assemblage of crystals of phosphate, spinel, and a residual glass system enriched in Ca, Mg, Zr, and B.The ultimate goal of this ongoing work is to obtain a kinetic model for crystallization of nepheline and enable compositional design to inhibit rapid crystallization of nepheline in high Na and Al wastes.\n",

The WTP that is being designed and constructed by a team led by Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) will separate the tank waste into High Level Waste (HLW) and Low Activity Waste (LAW) fractions with the majority of the mass (~90%) directed to LAW and most of the activity (>95%) directed to HLW. The pretreatment process, envisioned in the baseline, involves the dissolution of aluminum-bearing solids so as to allow the aluminum salts to be processed through the cesium ion exchange and report to the LAW Facility. There is an oxidative leaching process to affect a similar outcome for chromium-bearing wastes. Both of these unit operations were advanced to accommodate shortcomings in glass formulation for HLW inventories. A by-product of this are a series of technical challenges placed upon materials selected for the processing vessels. There exist additional questions on the adequacy of the design to ensure nuclear safety requirements are met during across the entire spectrum of possible operating conditions.At the heart of the treatment process is the vitrification of the HLW and LAW waste streams in Joule Heated Ceramic Melters (JHCMs). The JHCM is typically operated at a melt pool temperature of 1150°C. The slurry feed is introduced from the top of the melter and during operation the melt pool is almost entirely covered with unmelted feed termed the cold cap. The Hanford JHCMs are fitted with a patented bubbler system to agitate the melt pool, thus improving heat transfer to the cold cap and, therefore, feed processing rate. The Office of River Protection undertook an extensive investigation focused upon glass formulation improvements and enhancements of operating efficiencies in the vitrification facilities. The outcomes have the potential of profound, but positive, impacts on the baseline flow sheet for the Pretreatment Facility. Not forgetting the impact on more rapid realization of successfully emptying the waste tanks and treating the waste.The WTP will process and treat approximately 53 million gallons of mixed hazardous wastes (i.e., radioactive and chemical waste). This presentation provides an overview of the project status and technical challenges facing the process, design, and construction of the WTP facilities.\n",

Significant advantages could arise by placing and sealing SF and HLW wasteforms within boreholes drilled several kilometers into granitic basement rock compared to disposal in a repository a few hundred meters deep [2].The University of Sheffield in the UK has played a pivotal role in developing the DBD concept. Recent research has focused on sealing and support of the waste packages within the borehole as well as providing mechanical support for the load of the overlaying containers [3]. Any such dual purpose material must retain its key physical and chemical properties in a harsh environment; the temperature at the bottom of a borehole will be around 120°C (depending on borehole depth and the local geothermal gradient), with radiogenic heating from the waste packages increasing this value. One type of sealing/supporting matrix being developed in Sheffield is a cementitious grout for use when borehole wall temperatures are lower than approximately 200°C [3]. The exposure of a cementitious grout to these temperatures will dictate the properties of the wet paste before setting and its properties after hardening [1].In this publication we report the latest research into the design of a high performance cementing system suitable for providing down-hole sealing and support for waste packages. The performance of suitable cementitious systems is reviewed and development of an initial bespoke grout is described. This grout contains a siliceous component to provide the desirable physical/chemical properties at the high temperatures to which the grout will be exposed, as well as components to retard hydration of the cement during curing and retain the grout mix water during grout deployment through the water in the borehole. The rheological properties of the grout are being studied at pressures and temperatures representative of those at the bottom of a 5 km deep borehole focusing on assessing grout consistency, viscosity, yield stress and flow. The data presented here are being used to optimize the composition of the grout. This work is a precursor to assessing the performance of the grout in the hardened state in order to predict long-term durability in the challenging down-borehole environment.1. B. Arnold, P.

Therefore, materials science and sustainable engineering will continue to have important roles in five key thematic areas such as energy, transportation, housing, materials resources and health [1]. In parallel with the experimental efforts, computer-aided materials design is also an important factor in the fabrication of novel materials, to be applied in driving engineering innovations and urgent technological needs for achieving a sustainable society. The recent advent of metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), as new functional adsorbents has attracted the attention due to scientific interest in the creation of unprecedented regular nano-sized spaces and in the finding of novel phenomena, as well as commercial interest in their application for storage and separation. For MOFs the structural versatility of molecular chemistry has allowed the rational design and assembly of materials having novel topologies and exceptional host-guest properties that are important for urgent sustainable applications. Due to the regularity of MOF structures, in a computer simulation we are easily able to build structural models of MOFs that are very helpful to find new materials with desired characteristics.The aim of this study is detailed theoretical analysis the adsorption of targeted molecules into selected nanoporous materials in order to accelerate the realization of novel materials, hand-in-hand with experiment. Here, our recent achievements have been reported. The high sorption ability for acetylene on specific MOF material was determined [2], using both different experimental measurements and first-principles calculations which ascribe to the double hydrogen bond support between the acidic acetylene proton and its acceptor basic site on the channel surface. The absorption of several chiral sulfoxides, which constitute an important class of biologically active compounds and therapeutic drugs, into the homochiral porous coordination polymer has been also investigated [3]. In collaboration with experimentalists the specific nanoporous material that selectively adsorbs CO with adaptable pores has been studied using first-principles calculations. The high selectivity of CO has been achieved from a mixture with nitrogen by both the local interaction between CO and accessible open metal sites and the modification of nanopore size [4].REFERENCES[1] D.

B. R.  Varma 2  Navakanta  Bhat 1  Srinivasan  Raghavan 1  1Indian Institute of Science Bangalore India2Indian Institute of Science Bangalore IndiaShow AbstractThe scaling of silicon-based CMOS technology has hit a limit both in terms of the thickness of SiO2 based dielectric schemes, which are now limited by quantum tunneling, and secondly with respect to carrier injection from the drain into the Si channel. The first problem has been overcome by the use of high-k dielectrics, like zirconia and hafnia among many others. The issue of carrier injection necessitates the use of materials with high electron and hole mobilities, the most promising amongst them being Germanium having electron and hole mobilities of 3000 and 900 cm2/Vs respectively. Zirconia is known to form a stable interface with germanium unlike hafnia and hence can be used as high-k dielectric on Ge as a potential combination to replace conventional SiO2/Si for CMOS applications.For the first time, in this interesting study we correlate growth stress in the ZrO2 films to their crystallinity and dielectric permittivity. Our results showed that compressive growth stress alone can change the ZrO2 films relative permitivity from 5 to 23. And effect of further increase in stress was also studied.We reported electrical and structural characterization of ZrO2 /n-Ge [100] by reactive-direct current sputtering. As zirconia has phase dependent anisotropic dielectric permitivity. For the first time a clear selection of phase in thin film was achieved by precise control of growth temperature, stress and film thickness. Amorphous, tetragonal and monoclinic phases of zirconia were studied.The best EOT of 8 Å at 5 nm oxide thickness was achieved in sputter deposited zirconia. A novel stack was proposed to reduce leakage current density in MOS capacitor structures, which showed promising leakage current reduction by an order of magnitude.\n",

Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was employed to produce the polymeric thin films, since it provides organized molecular architecture at nanoscale level [4]. We have mixed, amphiphilic molecules (stearic acid - SA) to poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs): poly(3-butylthiophene), poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(3-octylthiophene), in order to improve deposition via Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The solutions of P3ATs/SA were fabricated with 43 molecular percentage of stearic acid that was chosen, among other films with different molecular percentages, due to good quality films and high conductivity presented. The mixed LB films were fabricated using a Langmuir trough model KSV 5000 and it was observed the deposition parameters. Film growth in hydrophobic glass was supervised using the UV-Visible optical absorption. Film morphology and roughness were analyzed through Atomic Force Microscopy. Electrical measurements, current versus voltage (I vs. V), and current versus time (I vs. t) were carried out in the IDE using Keithley 238 source-measure unit. In order to characterize the sensor behavior it was measured the current versus time with a fixed applied voltage of 5V on the presence of the VOCs: toluene, dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran in dynamic flow, dragged by nitrogen. The electrical measurements were performed using the parallel contact that was obtained by depositing P3ATs/SA LB film on interdigitated electrodes (IDE). Thin films showed, in current versus time (I vs. t) curve, sensibility to the VOCs, with a decrease in the current value. Despite the incomplete reversibility of the process, sensors can be used several times. Even after a film have detected a VOC, the same film can detect different VOCs.We acknowledge support from CAPES, FAPESP, CNPQ/INEO and LNLS.[1] S. Ozawa et al.

Combining metals, dielectric, semiconductors and soft polymers in unusual nano-architectures allows extreme control over the coupling of light and matter, producing advanced optical functionality. However constructing such nano-materials has been a huge problem, and must be overcome for applications to emerge in widespread technologies. While top-down fabrication is effective for small area 2D materials, for many applications volume production of 3D metamaterials is needed. In this talk I will present a number of new approaches to produce mass-scale visible-wavelength plasmonic- and meta-material films.A breakthrough for 3D metallic architectures for visible wavelength metamaterials has been enabled by our exploitation of block-copolymers to create large-area 3D gyroidal nano-architectures with 30-50nm unit cells and 10nm strut dimensions [1]. We investigate their linear and nonlinear optical properties, showing such ‘holey Au&’ has tuneable plasma edge into the infrared, with massively enhanced transmission in select resonances.An alternative route to novel woodpile photonic crystals and metamaterials manufactured over areas of several cm that operate in the visible regime, involves multiply-stacking sheets of gold wires supported by ultrathin polymer films. With 3D periodicities down to 134nm, we create strong resonant reflectors that can be flex tuned, with tuneable properties.Nanoparticle dimers can be used as ultrasensitive plasmonic sensors, but generation of reproducible signals requires accurate control over particle separation. Here we use an innovative DNA origami design to create strongly coupled gold NP dimers in high yield (>80%) with reproducible and accessible gaps of 3nm [2]. Supercontinuum spectroscopy of many individual dimers shows the reproducibility, and demonstrates massive surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Since this is a simply scalable technology it has significant implications for building plasmonic sensors directly in the field [3].Light can be used not only to characterize such materials, but can also be used for their structural modification. Here, we show how intense laser light can be employed to induce metallic threads between precisely assembled nanoparticles with sub-nm gaps with real time optical feedback. We also show how such controlled laser-sculpting can be extended to large scales by threading millions of nanoparticle chains in suspension simultaneously maintaining accurate control over their diameter [4]. Pulsed laser light becomes an inexpensive and effective tool to manipulate structures at the nanoscale that can easily be scaled up to meet the requirements of industrial production.[1] Adv Mat 25, 2713 (2013)[2] Nat.

Such substrates usually present a passive material (glass, plastic, silicon, etc) wafers covered with metallic nanoscale structures. Effective SERS-active substrates have to show great enhancement of the Raman signal from analyte molecules adhered on their surface, its reproducibility and storage stability. Despite successful substrates can be simulated their practical use requires an experimental work including fabrication process which often consists of a number of complicated steps.In this observation we present the results of our several years&’ work which has been devoted to a development of solid SERS-active substrates based on metallized porous silicon. We have used meso- or macroporous silicon as a template for a nanostructuring metals by their liquid deposition (electrochemical, electroless, immersion). As a result different types of metallic nanostructures have been formed including dendrites, spherical nanoparticles, nanostructured continuous films and nanovoids. Using various noble metals and hybrid metallic structures (noble-transition metals) has provided controllable managing SERS-signal intensity from rhodamine 6G and some metallic porphyrines.It has been found that enhancement factor and detection limit of SERS-active substrates based on porous silicon can reach at least 109 and 10-12 M, respectively.The reproducibility of the signal intensity from substrate to substrate and across the single substrate has been shown to range from 80 to 93 %. SERS-activity of the substrates has been found to be constant for at least three-six months depending on metallic nanostructure type. Further successful application requires refreshment of the metallic structure in diluted acids for several seconds.A principal advantage of the proposed substrates is their simple fabrication which has allowed to perform a great number of the experiments devoted to their characterizing and optimization resulting in significant SERS-activity and suitability for practical use.\n",

Beyond individual NPs, three-dimensional porous networks assembled from uniform metal-oxide NPs hold great promise for the development of novel materials with advantageous characteristics. For instance, the unique catalytic activity of NPs will be best exploited when they are integrated into extended mesoscopic structures [2]. This is because a three-dimensional pore structure may enable fast diffusion of the target molecules along the NPs, yet could prevent interparticle sintering during catalytic reactions. In addition, the organization of catalytic or plasmonic NPs into aligned nanostructures could induce new collective properties between adjacent particles not present in the original constituents [3].In this work, we report the synthesis of unique mesoporous Fe2O3 NP assemblies (Fe2O3-NPAs) through a surfactant-assisted aggregating assembly method. Also, we utilized post-synthetic deposition of gold on surface of Fe2O3-NPAs to prepare complex mesostructures of 2% Au-loaded Fe2O3 NPs (Au/Fe2O3-NPAs). The resulting Au/Fe2O3 hybrid mesoporous NPAs, which comprise small Fe2O3 nanocrystals (ca. 8 nm) and Au NPs (ca. 5 nm), possess a three-dimensional open-pore structure with a BET surface area of 123 m2/g and narrow mesopores (ca. 6 nm) These hybrid NPAs structures showed high catalytic activity and chemical stability for the selective reduction of nitroarenes into the corresponding amines using1,1,3,3-tetramethyl disiloxane (TMDS) as reducing agent under ambient conditions. We show that the electronic effect of the para-substituent has an important influence on the hydrogenation rate and nitroarenes possessing electron-acceptor group, such as methyl-4-nitrobenzoate, were quantitatively reduced to the desired amines in a shorter reaction time (30 min) than those nitro-compounds containing the electron-donating group, e.g. 4-methoxy nitrobenzene (2 h). A mechanistic study of the reduction of nitroarenes into the corresponding anilines in the presence of hydrosilanes using Au/Fe2O3 NPAs is also discussed.References[1] Z. Nie, A. Petukhova and E.

Markvicka 1  Carmel  Majidi 1  1Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh United StatesShow AbstractSoft, multifunctional materials are key components for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and human/machine interfaces. These applications demand soft materials that undergo large deformations in potentially non-planar configurations without imposing a large mechanical impedance mismatch with the component or user. Although various functional materials such as soft sensors, actuators, and active materials have been demonstrated, the integration of multiple functionalities into a single material is still an emerging area of research. Importantly, multifunctional materials require a comprehensive approach which simultaneously considers material integration schemes, geometric and scaling considerations, and fabrication techniques to enable efficient material investigation and assembly. Here, we start with soft, readily available films and assemble them through rapid prototyping techniques such as laser machining and adhesive controlled material transfer to efficiently create multifunctional soft materials. Characterization of sensor functionality is examined experimentally by simultaneously measuring mechanical deformation and electrical properties such as resistance and capacitance. Under in-plane, tensile deformation, electrical signals increases monotonically with strain while stretching over twice the original length. In the thru-thickness direction, pressure sensing is examined by creating ‘electronic skins&’ that can detect pressure from 0.2 to 20 kPa. Additionally, if these sensors are deformed beyond their sensing limit and conductivity is lost, the sensor can regain functionality by removing the applied strain. Actuator and on-demand material property control are further demonstrated and characterized through benchtop experiments. This work demonstrates a scalable approach to soft, multifunctional materials while offering versatility in design and functionality for a variety of applications through material selection and construction.\n",

Promising breath markers for lung2 and breast cancer3 are aldehydes as their increased levels were detected in affected patients. Portable and simple#8209;in#8209;use aldehyde analyzers could contribute significantly to the implementation and widespread application of breath analysis for medical self-diagnostics and simple body parameter monitoring. Chemo-resistive gas sensors are ideal as they offer sufficient analyte sensitivity, fast response and recovery times for real-time monitoring, simple operation and they have been tested already in a portable design.4 Well-known chemo-resistive materials, however, suffer from insufficient aldehyde selectivity in the complex5 analyte matrix of human breath. To overcome this challenge, arrays of multiple non-specific sensors are a viable option where selectivity is obtained by statistical analysis of the sensor responses.6Here, we present a microsensor array consisting of four differently doped SnO2 films for selective formaldehyde (FA) detection. The microsensor substrates are silicon wafer-based and fabricated by state-of-the-art micro-processing technology. Rapid flame aerosol synthesis is applied to produce the sensing nanoparticles (~10 nm) that are accurately deposited onto the substrates in designated areas (d = 500 mu;m). The resulting nanostructured and highly porous film morphology offers high sensitivity that is quite attractive for breath analysis. These sensors are combined in arrays featuring a compact size and low power consumption (~2 W) at operational conditions. The derived arrays are tested on simulated breath mixtures at 90% rh. Breath-relevant FA concentrations (30 - 200 ppb) are clearly identified that could allow detection of cancer. Such microsensor arrays have high potential for further development towards a portable breath analyzer. The compact size and low power consumption make them attractive for integration into portable electronic devices (e.g. smart phone).(1) Bray, F.; Jemal, A.; Grey, N.; Ferlay, J.; Forman, D.

[1] Integrating this interesting property on flexible and non-planar substrates can present a new generation of photonic devices, especially a wearable nanoplasmonic biosensor. Such bio-interface requires an ability to fabricate metallic nanostructures on a flexible platform with a functional probe that interacts with biochemical molecules. In this report, we demonstrate the fabrication of highly ordered side edge pre-functionalized (SEPF) nanostructures on flexible substrates by transfer printing and the ultrasensitive detection particularly for miRNA-21 using nanoplasmonic assembly based on the fabricated platform.Metallic nanostructures provide highly enhanced distribution of electric field along the side edges upon coupling with the incident light. Using the properties, we not only achieved the highest field confinement in the hetero assemblies for sensitive detection but also eliminated the negative influence of non-specific binding that induces an irrelevant signal enhancement by using a targeted functionalization on the side edge of the SEPF nanostructures. These results allow us to accurately measure the interparticle gap associated with the near-field coupling between the nanostructures and the nanoparticles. The methods for making the SEPF nanostructures were carried out by transfer printing exploiting a pre-functionalization process of bioactive molecules and anti-adhesion layers for releasing gold nanostructures to flexible substrates.To investigate the biosensing capability using this SEPF nanostructure, sample was prepared with non-coding miRNA-21 which is a promising non-invasive biomarker for the pathogenesis of various diseases found in body fluids. The arrays of SEPF nanostructures having the width of 500 nm and the height of 100 nm were used for selectively identifying the miRNA-21 with plasmon coupling. The gap distances between the SEPF ND and 10, 30 nm sized NPs were 7~8 nm for the hybridizing experiment with miRNA-21. Pre-functionalization of the nanostructure sidewalls with RNA probes during the transfer process enables the assemblies with Au nanoparticles along the edge where target miRNA can hybridize. This platform integrated on the flexible substrate results in the enhanced detection to a 10 fM miRNA concentration with a wide dynamic range from 1 fM to 100 pM. Specificity of our biosensor towards miRNA-21 detection has been addressed already in our previous work.

It exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance compared to MWCNTs due to the unique features of GWCNTs, such as highly protruded outer graphene layers and inner tubular morphology. Up on anchoring Pd NPs, the hybrid showed glucose electroxidation at a very low working potential of +0.05 V resulting from its enhanced electrocatalytic activity and rapid charge transfer. The developed biosensor demonstrate excellent sensing behaviour for glucose with a wide linear calibration range up to 19.5 mM, good reproducibility, especially a very fast response time (within 0.1 s) with a low detection limit of 1 µM (S/N = 3). Further it displayed significant selectivity to glucose in the presence of coexisting interference species such as dopamine, uric acid, ascorbic acid, sucrose, fructose and lactose. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent reproducibility (~84.5% recovery over a period of one week) and outstanding stable amperometric response over a time of 4000 s. This outperformance of the fabricated biosensor could be due to the synergetic advantage of catalytic Pd NPs anchored on edge-plane like sites in GWCNTs, which facilitate low-potential glucose electroxidation.4 On the basis of the above results, the biosensor shows great promise as a low-cost sensor kit for enzymeless glucose detection in various fields such as healthcare monitoring, medical diagnosis, bioprocessing and environmental monitoring.Keyword: non-enzymatic, Graphene wrapped carbon nanotubes, glucose biosensor, selectivity, stability.References:1.

The reversible molecular association of SAPs has been shown to macroscopically lead to self-supporting gels, offering great promise in therapeutics e.g. bone and enamel regeneration[1]. Self-assembled gels typically display weak mechanical properties. Although these gels could have been applied as e.g. injectable scaffold in treatment of small size bone/tooth defects[2], their mechanical stability is insufficient for large load-bearing bones and there are challenges in implanting them into tissue defects. Incorporation of SAPs into polymeric matrices is a common strategy to enhance their mechanical stability[3]; however integrated methods enabling fibre assembly at both micro and molecular levels are lacking. To address the above mentioned challenge, this research investigated the encapsulation of two types of tape forming 11 amino acid residue SAP within a poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous web via. an electrospinning process. With regards to electrostatic charges during spinning process, P11-4 (CH3COQQRFEWEFEQQNH2) with -2 net charge and P11-8 (CH3COQQRFOWOFEQQNH2, where O is ornithine) with +2 net charge were selected as model SAPs. Resulting webs exhibited interesting biphasic nano- and micro-structural features resulting from simultaneous fabrication processes at molecular and microscopic level. The novel mechanism of fabricating electrospun PCL sub-micron fibres containing self assembled peptide nano-fibrils in a simple one-step process is resulting from the SAP monomeric assembly and the spinning process. FTIR and CD spectroscopy results on PCL-peptide solutions suggested that monomeric peptide self-assembly takes place during or immediately after electrospinning, while FTIR spectroscopy highlighted a β-sheet secondary conformation across the fibres. Peptide concentration and its net charge were found to be highly influential in the fibrous morphology and specifically in determining the nano-scale structure of the fabric. The direct and indirect cell culture studies on the electrospun self-assembled matrices demonstrated a spread-like morphology of L929 mouse fibroblasts. The biphasic structure combines the benefits of nano-fibres, suitable for cell attachment and submicron fibres with open pore areas suitable for cell penetration and differentiation [4].Considering the current challenges of 3D scaffolds such as lack of surface bioactivity or poor biomechanical stabilities, the investigations of these materials for mineralization of hard tissues are underway.[1] Stephanopoulos, N., et al.

Co3O4 has technological importance principally due to their applications in Lithium batteries. This oxide has a spinel structure in which Co3+ ions occupy octahedral sites and do not contribute to the magnetic properties while the Co2+ ions in tetrahedral sites are arranged antiferromagnetically below TN~30K[1].Our crystals were synthesized by Pechini Method. CoSO4.7H2O was used as precursor and the resin obtained was calcinated at 800°C during 3 hours. The sample microstructure was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility (chi; and chi;') as a function of applied magnetic field (H) and as a function of temperature (T) in the range of 1.8K-300K measurements were performed using a SQUID-VSM magnetometer.Cubic Co3O4 (ICSD Code:24210) is the only phase present in the sample and SEM image showed particles with diameter between 100nm and 1200nm, with 68nm of crystallite size on average. In chi; versus T data two peaks are evident, the first, at Tf=14K (freezing temperature) has a remarkable response to H, disappearing for Hge;35kOe and the second TN=32K is well described in the literature as being the Néel temperature for Co3O4 bulk. As chi; versus T measurements are efficient to determine the freezing temperature but are not sufficient to investigate its nature we performed chi;' versus T measurements for a driven field HAC=10 Oe and HDC=0 Oe. In these analysis we observed that the peak at~32K is kept fixed by varying the driven frequency, in accordance with a transition characteristic of the antiferromagnetic material, although, as a result of frustration, the maximum at 14K presents an increase of intensity as higher is the driven frequency. Furthermore, an increase of chi; values for temperatures below Tf was also observed and is associated to uncompensated moments on the nanocrystals surface. The system also presented an exponential relaxation for remanent magnetization and two distinct behaviors in the M/H versus H curves. Around Tf there is an decrease of M/H values as H is increased, although, the same starts increasing around 4.5kOe reaching a plateau at 55kOe. Around TN the M/H values decrease for all H range and the curve also reaches a plateau which is close to that observed for M/H values around Tf, however less intense.Analyzing these data we suggest that below Tf the system is in a metastable state in which there is a competition between uncompensated superficial moments and the moments associated to the antiferromagnetic bulk portion, an result of changes in the particles surface attributed to the particle size reduction[2]. Results showed that the metastable state is dependent not only on temperature but also on applied fields.[1] J. Phys. Chem. Solids, vol. 25, pp. 1-10,1964.[2] J. Appl.

Recently, GaP and AlGaP in the WZ phase have been theoretically and experimentally shown to have direct band gaps, indicating the possibility of increasing the efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [2,3]. We have also reported on WZ InP/AlGaP core-shell nanowires toward green LEDs [4]. In this study, we focus on WZ InP/AlInP core-shell nanowires because the WZ AlInP ternary alloys are expected to have direct band gaps in the entire compositional range [2], and are therefore promising for red, amber, and yellow LEDs.Selective-area growth of WZ InP nanowires were first performed at 660°C for 15 min with a V/III ratio of 18, which is the typical condition for the WZ structure [1]. AlInP shell was then grown at 600°C for 30 min. A total of five samples were grown with changing aluminum compositions in a range from 0 to 0.66. The diameter of InP core and the thickness of AlInP shell was estimated to be about 140 and 110 nm, respectively. The structural properties of the core-shell nanowires were investigated by reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) using X-ray diffraction measurements. From these measurements, we consider that the AlInP shell on the side has WZ structures and that the AlInP shell on the top has ZB structures. It is also found that the strain between the core and shell remained in the samples with low aluminum compositions.In order to investigate the optical properties of WZ AlInP, we next fabricated InP/AlInP core-multishell nanowires with quantum well structures in the AlInP shell. The aluminum composition of the barrier layer and quantum well layer were estimated to be 0.57 and 0.33. Cathode luminescence (CL) measurements were performed at 34K on an individual nanowire. The emission peak of WZ AlInP appeared around 1.8-2.0 eV, showing a red emission. The intensity of WZ AlInP was much higher than that of previously reported WZ AlGaP. This is because the AlInP shell has a smaller lattice mismatch to the InP core and therefore the crystal quality of the AlInP shell is higher, as compared to the AlGaP shell. Further optical studies will be discussed to investigate the band gap of WZ AlInP.[1] Y. Kitauchi et al., Nano Lett., 10, 1699 (2010).[2] A. De et al., Phys. Rev. B, 81, 155210 (2010).[3] S.

However, to date, few methods exist to synthesize or fabricate such complex materials. Metal can diffuse along semiconductor surfaces, and even trace amount can change the surface behavior. We exploit the phenomena for three-dimensional mesoscale lithography, by showing one example where iterated deposition-diffusion-incorporation of gold over silicon nanowires forms etchant-resistant patterns. Using a combined anisotropic alkaline etching and facet selective etchant-resistant patterning process, silicon nanowires with three-dimensional mesostructures were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Their novel three-dimensional mesoscale features, such as skeleton-like morphology, three-dimensional tectonic motifs, and reduced symmetries, were revealed by electron microscopy and tomography. Quantitative analysis of the gold-diffused pattern on silicon nanowires implies a gold/silicon reaction limited patterning process. Comprehensive characterization using atom-probe tomography, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy,and electrochemical measurement, indicates the existence and the role of individual gold atoms in forming three-dimensional lithographic resists.\n",

The NO2 reacts with the intern mucus membrane of lungs, and is at the origin of large increase of respiratory diseases. Various international agencies recommend level of long period exposures well below the olfactory detection level (300ppb).Most commercial sensors, using metal oxide as sensitive layer, exhibit sensitivity in the ppm range. Moreover to be efficient, these layers operate at elevated temperatures, which drastically increase the global power consumption of the device. One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires [1] or nanotubes [2], hold a great potential for the new generation of high sensitive sensors due to the high surface-to-volume ratio operating at a room temperature (low consumption). However, very few demonstrations showed sub-50 ppb sensitivity. Two nanowire based-sensors exhibit 20ppb sensitivity in air with In2O3 [3] and Si [4] nanowires but with some remaining critical drawbacks to address in term of recovery of the sensing mechanism or device repeatability.Here, we report new miniaturized chemical gas sensors, working at room temperature, based on 3D silicon nanowires (SiNW) device, which is developed through a large scale approach. The vertical SiNW networks are patterned by top-down approach, which combines photolithography and sacrificial oxidation to precisely control the dimension, number, spacing and position of each nanowire in order to achieve high reproducibility. The device is composed by two symmetrical Al contacts (low access resistance) at each extremity of the NWs, including a top contact done by air bridge approach. Under controlled atmosphere, the sensor demonstrates gas selectivity, by discriminating NO2 and NH3, without being interfered with CO and C3H8. Due to the enhanced adsorption surface conferring by the 3D configuration, extremely low sensibility level has been reached. A very high response (30%) is obtained at 50ppb of NO2, the dilution limit of our test bench, in comparison of the 25% reached for 200ppb in [4], indicating that lowest detectable NO2 concentration by our device is greatly below 20ppb. Furthermore, the recovery of the sensor is achieved naturally at room temperature, without flushing [3] or specific illumination for the molecules desorption [4] with a reliability over 6 months.In summary, we demonstrated detection of NO2 down to ppb level, using resistor gas sensors based on 3D SiNW networks. This device combines for the first time high sensibility, selectivity, reversibility, low-power consumption, reliability and low-cost large scale and CMOS compatible fabrication.[1] N.S.

In fact with the large surface to volume ratio that characterizes the nanostructures, the surface becomes even more important than in bulk material and justifies the need of a specific and detailed characterization. The Schottky barrier can be studied directly in devices analyzing current-voltage (I-V) or capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics based on thermionic emission model1,2. The use of X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) allows the investigation of the early stage of the formation of the Schottky barrier, supplying complementary information and helping to understand the physics beneath the device operation. On the other hand, XPS on metal covered semiconductor NWs has been scarcely investigated3, due to the difficulty of performing similar measurement with standard equipment.For this work, we have grown GaAs NWs by molecular beam epitaxy, using gold as growth seed and tellurium or silicon impurities to obtain n4 or p5 doping, respectively. In order to keep the surface of the NWs clean prior to evaporate the metal, they were covered in the growth chamber by amorphous As. They were then mechanically transferred from the growth substrate to a silicon wafer, to have isolated NWs lying on the surface. In situ annealing at 350 °C removed the amorphous As right before the start of the measurements.We employed X-Ray PhotoEmission Microscopy (XPEEM) to determinate the Schottky barrier between doped GaAs nanowires and copper. The experiments were carried out at the NanoESCA beamline of the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility (Trieste, Italy).Our technique permits to select electrons with a well-defined binding energy, constructing an image showing the lateral distribution and amount of the emitting element. Acquiring XPEEM images at different binding energies we can extract the As and Ga 3d core levels spectra of individual NWs at increasing Cu coverages. From a preliminary analysis the Schottky barrier has been derived using well known relations6, obtaining for Te-doped GaAs NWs a barrier height of about q#981;n=0.4 eV and q#981;p=0.6 eV for Si-doped GaAs NWs.Theoretical calculations7 predict a dependence of the Schottky barrier height on the diameter of the NWs. Being the NWs several micrometers long and tapered, the lateral resolution of the instrument in XPEEM mode (sim;70 nm) allows us to follow possible variation of the signal along the NW axis. The analysis of the axial dependence of the barrier is presently ongoing.1 F. Leonard et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 106805 (2009)2 C.-H. Hsu et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 101, 183103 (2012)3 S. N.

The combination of their small dimensions and excellent optical waveguiding properties make them ideal candidates for quantum light sources to be used in quantum computing and quantum cryptography. In this paper we describe the growth of position and diameter controlled wurtzite InP nanowires using Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE), and demonstrate their excellent optical properties.The InP nanowires were grown using a selective area vapour-liquid-solid growth process which allows the precise positioning of nanowires on the substrate, and simultaneous control of their diameter to within a few nm. This allowed us to remove competing substrate surface growth and control the clad nanowire diameter. We investigated the effect of growth rate and V-III ratio on the crystal phase purity, with low growth rates and group V fluxes resulting in wurtzite nanowires with very low stacking fault densities (<1/µm could be achieved). Photoluminescence (PL) showed that as the nanowires increased in diameter the density of crystal phase defects (stacking faults and zincblende insertions) increased. Time resolved PL was found to be even more sensitive than c.w. PL to the presence of crystal phase defects at low defect densities.By increasing the group V flux by a factor of 3 it was possible to change the nanowire growth mode from axial to radial. This allowed the growth of a high crystal phase purity wurtzite nanowire core, typically 20 nm in diameter, which could then be increased in diameter to >250 nm. Using the nanowire core as a template in this way resulted in the large diameter wire also being pure wurtzite. The increased nanowire diameter resulted in a dramatic increase in the emission and collection efficiency of photons emitted by the nanowire through strong waveguiding effects. Photon collection efficiencies into a single mode fibre approaching 100% could be achieved.By incorporating single InAsP quantum dots in the InP nanowire core a high brightness single photon source was demonstrated. Extremely clean single dot spectra were measured due to the lack of competing stacking fault/zincblende emission, or emission from planar substrate growth due to the selective area nature of the growth process. This source exhibited linewidths as narrow as 3 µeV, probabilities of multiphoton emission g2(0)<0.005, and count rates as high as 320,000 counts/s.\n",

R.  Mehta 1  1Indian Institute of Technology Delhi New Delhi India2Delhi Technological University New Delhi IndiaShow AbstractIn the present study, hydrogenation properties of Pd-C core-shell nanoparticles having controllable Pd nanoparticle core and carbon shell thickness have been investigated. An integrated gas phase synthesis method comprising of spark generator, neutralizer, differential mobility analyzer (DMA), sintering furnace and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is used for the synthesis of the nanoparticles. A carbon precursor gas (CH4) is introduced in the furnace which gets dissociated into carbon atoms at high temperatures and covers the compacted Pd nanoparticles to form Pd-C core-shell nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) studies on Pd-C nanoparticles of mobility equivalent diameter of 20, 40 and 60 nm and carbon shell thickness of 0, 1.5 and 2.1 nm have been investigated and the results have been understood in terms of size and surface effects. A larger H/Pd ratio in Pd-C nanoparticles having larger carbon shell thickness and smaller nanoparticle size has been obtained from the elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). These results are explained on the basis of lowering of coordination number of Pd surface sites at Pd-C core-shell interface and size induced lattice distortion effects resulting in changes in the position of Pd 4d level. By combining the modification in electronic properties due to the size with that due to carbon shell thickness, Pd-H interaction can be significantly enhanced.\n",
